    Represents a Jupyter notebook widget used to view the progress of model training.

    A widget is asynchronous and provides updates until training finishes.

    :param run_instance: Run instance for which the widget will be rendered.
    :type run_instance: azureml.core.run.Run

    .. remarks::

        An Azure ML Jupyter Notebook widget shows the progress of model training, including properties, logs, and
        metrics. The selected widget type is inferred implicitly from the ``run_instance``. You don't need to set it
        explicitly. Use the :meth:`show` method to begin rendering of the widget. If the widget isn't installed,
        you'll instead see a link to view the content in a new browser page. After starting an experiment, you can
        also see the progress of model training in the Azure portal using the ``get_portal_url()`` method of
        the :class:`azureml.core.Run` class.

        The following example shows how to create a widget and start it:

        .. code-block:: python

            from azureml.widgets import RunDetails

            RunDetails(remote_run).show()

        Full sample is available from
        https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/python-sdk/tutorials/automl-with-azureml/classification-credit-card-fraud/auto-ml-classification-credit-card-fraud.ipynb



        The following types of runs are supported:

        * :class:`azureml.pipeline.core.StepRun`: Shows run properties, output logs, metrics.
        * :class:`azureml.train.hyperdrive.HyperDriveRun`: Shows parent run properties, logs, child runs, primary
          metric chart, and parallel coordinate chart of hyperparameters.
        * :class:`azureml.train.automl.run.AutoMLRun`: Shows child runs and primary metric chart with option to select
          individual metrics.
        * :class:`azureml.pipeline.core.run.PipelineRun`: Shows running and non-running nodes of a pipeline along
          with graphical representation of nodes and edges.
        * :class:`azureml.contrib.train.rl.ReinforcementLearningRun`: Shows status of runs in real time.
          Azure Machine Learning Reinforcement Learning
          is currently a preview feature. For more information, see `Reinforcement learning with Azure Marchine
          Learning <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-reinforcement-learning>`_.

        The `azureml-widgets` package is installed when you install the Azure Machine Learning SDK. However, some
        further installation may be needed depending on environment.

        * Jupyter Notebooks: Both local and cloud notebooks are fully supported, with interactivity, async
          auto-updates, and non-blocking cell execution.
        * JupyterLab: Some further installation may be needed.
            1. Verify that the `azure-widgets` package is installed and if not, install it.

               .. code-block:: shell

                    sudo -i pip install azureml-widgets

            1. Install JupyterLab Extension.

              .. code-block:: shell

                    sudo -i jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

            1. After installation, restart the kernel in all currently running notebooks.

               .. code-block:: shell

                    jupyter labextension list

        * Databricks: Partial support for Juypter Notebook widgets. When you use the widget, it will display a link
          to view the content in a new browser page. Use the :meth:`show` with the ``render_lib`` parameter set to
          'displayHTML'.
