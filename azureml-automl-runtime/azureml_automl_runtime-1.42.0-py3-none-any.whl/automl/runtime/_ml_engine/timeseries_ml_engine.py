    """
    Compute model evaluation metrics for a forecasting task.

    `y_max`, `y_min`, and `y_std` should be based on `y_test` information unless
    you would like to compute multiple metrics for comparison (ex. cross validation),
    in which case, you should use a common range and standard deviation. You may
    also pass in `y_max`, `y_min`, and `y_std` if you do not want it to be calculated.

    All metrics present in `metrics` will be present in the output dictionary with either
    the value(s) calculated or `nan` if metric calculation failed.

    :param y_test: The target values.
    :param y_pred: The predicted values.
    :param metrics: List of metric names for metrics to calculate.
    :type metrics: list
    :param horizons: The horizon of each prediction. If missing or not relevant, pass None.
    :param y_max: The max target value.
    :param y_min: The min target value.
    :param y_std: The standard deviation of targets value.
    :param sample_weight:
        The sample weight to be used on metrics calculation. This does not need
        to match sample weights on the fitted model.
    :param bin_info:
        The binning information for true values. This should be calculated from make_dataset_bins. Required for
        calculating non-scalar metrics.
    :param X_test: The inputs which were used to compute the predictions.
    :param X_train: The inputs which were used to train the model.
    :param y_train: The targets which were used to train the model.
    :param grain_column_names: The grain column name.
    :param time_column_name: The time column name.
    :param origin_column_name: The origin time column name.
