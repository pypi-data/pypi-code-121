# AWS Batch Construct Library

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

AWS Batch is a batch processing tool for efficiently running hundreds of thousands computing jobs in AWS. Batch can dynamically provision different types of compute resources based on the resource requirements of submitted jobs.

AWS Batch simplifies the planning, scheduling, and executions of your batch workloads across a full range of compute services like [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [Spot Resources](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/).

Batch achieves this by utilizing queue processing of batch job requests. To successfully submit a job for execution, you need the following resources:

1. [Job Definition](#job-definition) - *Group various job properties (container image, resource requirements, env variables...) into a single definition. These definitions are used at job submission time.*
2. [Compute Environment](#compute-environment) - *the execution runtime of submitted batch jobs*
3. [Job Queue](#job-queue) - *the queue where batch jobs can be submitted to via AWS SDK/CLI*

For more information on **AWS Batch** visit the [AWS Docs for Batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/index.html).

## Compute Environment

At the core of AWS Batch is the compute environment. All batch jobs are processed within a compute environment, which uses resource like OnDemand/Spot EC2 instances or Fargate.

In **MANAGED** mode, AWS will handle the provisioning of compute resources to accommodate the demand. Otherwise, in **UNMANAGED** mode, you will need to manage the provisioning of those resources.

Below is an example of each available type of compute environment:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


# default is managed
aws_managed_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "AWS-Managed-Compute-Env",
    compute_resources=ec2.aws_batch.ComputeResources(
        vpc=vpc
    )
)

customer_managed_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "Customer-Managed-Compute-Env",
    managed=False
)
```

### Spot-Based Compute Environment

It is possible to have AWS Batch submit spotfleet requests for obtaining compute resources. Below is an example of how this can be done:

```python
vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "VPC")

spot_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "MySpotEnvironment",
    compute_resources=ec2.aws_batch.ComputeResources(
        type=batch.ComputeResourceType.SPOT,
        bid_percentage=75,  # Bids for resources at 75% of the on-demand price
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

### Fargate Compute Environment

It is possible to have AWS Batch submit jobs to be run on Fargate compute resources. Below is an example of how this can be done:

```python
vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "VPC")

fargate_spot_environment = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "MyFargateEnvironment",
    compute_resources=ec2.aws_batch.ComputeResources(
        type=batch.ComputeResourceType.FARGATE_SPOT,
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

### Understanding Progressive Allocation Strategies

AWS Batch uses an [allocation strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html) to determine what compute resource will efficiently handle incoming job requests. By default, **BEST_FIT** will pick an available compute instance based on vCPU requirements. If none exist, the job will wait until resources become available. However, with this strategy, you may have jobs waiting in the queue unnecessarily despite having more powerful instances available. Below is an example of how that situation might look like:

```plaintext
Compute Environment:

1. m5.xlarge => 4 vCPU
2. m5.2xlarge => 8 vCPU
```

```plaintext
Job Queue:
---------
| A | B |
---------

Job Requirements:
A => 4 vCPU - ALLOCATED TO m5.xlarge
B => 2 vCPU - WAITING
```

In this situation, Batch will allocate **Job A** to compute resource #1 because it is the most cost efficient resource that matches the vCPU requirement. However, with this `BEST_FIT` strategy, **Job B** will not be allocated to our other available compute resource even though it is strong enough to handle it. Instead, it will wait until the first job is finished processing or wait a similar `m5.xlarge` resource to be provisioned.

The alternative would be to use the `BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE` strategy in order for the remaining job to be handled in larger containers regardless of vCPU requirement and costs.

### Launch template support

Simply define your Launch Template:

```text
// This example is only available in TypeScript
const myLaunchTemplate = new ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate(this, 'LaunchTemplate', {
  launchTemplateName: 'extra-storage-template',
  launchTemplateData: {
    blockDeviceMappings: [
      {
        deviceName: '/dev/xvdcz',
        ebs: {
          encrypted: true,
          volumeSize: 100,
          volumeType: 'gp2',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

and use it:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# my_launch_template: ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate


my_compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "ComputeEnv",
    compute_resources=ec2.aws_batch.ComputeResources(
        launch_template=ec2.aws_batch.LaunchTemplateSpecification(
            launch_template_name=my_launch_template.launch_template_name
        ),
        vpc=vpc
    ),
    compute_environment_name="MyStorageCapableComputeEnvironment"
)
```

### Importing an existing Compute Environment

To import an existing batch compute environment, call `ComputeEnvironment.fromComputeEnvironmentArn()`.

Below is an example:

```python
compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment.from_compute_environment_arn(self, "imported-compute-env", "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:555555555555:compute-environment/My-Compute-Env")
```

### Change the baseline AMI of the compute resources

Occasionally, you will need to deviate from the default processing AMI.

ECS Optimized Amazon Linux 2 example:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

my_compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "ComputeEnv",
    compute_resources=ec2.aws_batch.ComputeResources(
        image=ecs.EcsOptimizedAmi(
            generation=ec2.AmazonLinuxGeneration.AMAZON_LINUX_2
        ),
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

Custom based AMI example:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

my_compute_env = batch.ComputeEnvironment(self, "ComputeEnv",
    compute_resources=ec2.aws_batch.ComputeResources(
        image=ec2.MachineImage.generic_linux({
            "[aws-region]": "[ami-ID]"
        }),
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

## Job Queue

Jobs are always submitted to a specific queue. This means that you have to create a queue before you can start submitting jobs. Each queue is mapped to at least one (and no more than three) compute environment. When the job is scheduled for execution, AWS Batch will select the compute environment based on ordinal priority and available capacity in each environment.

```python
# compute_environment: batch.ComputeEnvironment

job_queue = batch.JobQueue(self, "JobQueue",
    compute_environments=[ec2.aws_batch.JobQueueComputeEnvironment(
        # Defines a collection of compute resources to handle assigned batch jobs
        compute_environment=compute_environment,
        # Order determines the allocation order for jobs (i.e. Lower means higher preference for job assignment)
        order=1
    )
    ]
)
```

### Priorty-Based Queue Example

Sometimes you might have jobs that are more important than others, and when submitted, should take precedence over the existing jobs. To achieve this, you can create a priority based execution strategy, by assigning each queue its own priority:

```python
# shared_compute_envs: batch.ComputeEnvironment

high_prio_queue = batch.JobQueue(self, "JobQueue",
    compute_environments=[ec2.aws_batch.JobQueueComputeEnvironment(
        compute_environment=shared_compute_envs,
        order=1
    )],
    priority=2
)

low_prio_queue = batch.JobQueue(self, "JobQueue",
    compute_environments=[ec2.aws_batch.JobQueueComputeEnvironment(
        compute_environment=shared_compute_envs,
        order=1
    )],
    priority=1
)
```

By making sure to use the same compute environments between both job queues, we will give precedence to the `highPrioQueue` for the assigning of jobs to available compute environments.

### Importing an existing Job Queue

To import an existing batch job queue, call `JobQueue.fromJobQueueArn()`.

Below is an example:

```python
job_queue = batch.JobQueue.from_job_queue_arn(self, "imported-job-queue", "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:555555555555:job-queue/High-Prio-Queue")
```

## Job Definition

A Batch Job definition helps AWS Batch understand important details about how to run your application in the scope of a Batch Job. This involves key information like resource requirements, what containers to run, how the compute environment should be prepared, and more. Below is a simple example of how to create a job definition:

```python
import monocdk as ecr


repo = ecr.Repository.from_repository_name(self, "batch-job-repo", "todo-list")

batch.JobDefinition(self, "batch-job-def-from-ecr",
    container=ecr.aws_batch.JobDefinitionContainer(
        image=ecs.EcrImage(repo, "latest")
    )
)
```

### Using a local Docker project

Below is an example of how you can create a Batch Job Definition from a local Docker application.

```python
batch.JobDefinition(self, "batch-job-def-from-local",
    container=ec2.aws_batch.JobDefinitionContainer(
        # todo-list is a directory containing a Dockerfile to build the application
        image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_asset("../todo-list")
    )
)
```

### Providing custom log configuration

You can provide custom log driver and its configuration for the container.

```python
import monocdk as ssm


batch.JobDefinition(self, "job-def",
    container=ssm.aws_batch.JobDefinitionContainer(
        image=ecs.EcrImage.from_registry("docker/whalesay"),
        log_configuration=ssm.aws_batch.LogConfiguration(
            log_driver=batch.LogDriver.AWSLOGS,
            options={"awslogs-region": "us-east-1"},
            secret_options=[
                batch.ExposedSecret.from_parameters_store("xyz", ssm.StringParameter.from_string_parameter_name(self, "parameter", "xyz"))
            ]
        )
    )
)
```

### Importing an existing Job Definition

#### From ARN

To import an existing batch job definition from its ARN, call `JobDefinition.fromJobDefinitionArn()`.

Below is an example:

```python
job = batch.JobDefinition.from_job_definition_arn(self, "imported-job-definition", "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:555555555555:job-definition/my-job-definition")
```

#### From Name

To import an existing batch job definition from its name, call `JobDefinition.fromJobDefinitionName()`.
If name is specified without a revision then the latest active revision is used.

Below is an example:

```python
# Without revision
job1 = batch.JobDefinition.from_job_definition_name(self, "imported-job-definition", "my-job-definition")

# With revision
job2 = batch.JobDefinition.from_job_definition_name(self, "imported-job-definition", "my-job-definition:3")
```

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::Batch::ComputeEnvironment``.

    The ``AWS::Batch::ComputeEnvironment`` resource defines your AWS Batch compute environment. You can define ``MANAGED`` or ``UNMANAGED`` compute environments. ``MANAGED`` compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate resources. ``UNMANAGED`` compute environments can only use EC2 resources. For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`_ in the ** .

    In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the `launch template <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html>`_ that you specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose either to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances, or to use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.
    .. epigraph::

       Multi-node parallel jobs are not supported on Spot Instances.

    In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMI. However, you need to verify that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see `container instance AMIs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html>`_ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* . After you have created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the `DescribeComputeEnvironments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeComputeEnvironments.html>`_ operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is associated with it. Then, manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see `Launching an Amazon ECS container instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html>`_ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
    .. epigraph::

       AWS Batch doesn't upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it's created except under specific conditions. For example, it doesn't automatically update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you're responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. There are two ways to use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs. The original method is to complete these steps:

       - Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.
       - Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.
       - Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.
       - Delete the earlier compute environment.

       In April 2022, AWS Batch added enhanced support for updating compute environments. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . To use the enhanced updating of compute environments to update AMIs, follow these rules:

       - Either do not set the `ServiceRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-batch-computeenvironment.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-servicerole>`_ property or set it to the *AWSServiceRoleForBatch* service-linked role.
       - Set the `AllocationStrategy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-allocationstrategy>`_ property to ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` or ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` .
       - Set the `ReplaceComputeEnvironment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-batch-computeenvironment.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-replacecomputeenvironment>`_ property to ``false`` .
       - Set the `UpdateToLatestImageVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-updatetolatestimageversion>`_ property to ``true`` .
       - Either do not specify an image ID in `ImageId <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-imageid>`_ or `ImageIdOverride <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-ec2configurationobject.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-ec2configurationobject-imageidoverride>`_ properties, or in the launch template identified by the `Launch Template <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources-launchtemplate>`_ property. In that case AWS Batch will select the latest Amazon ECS optimized AMI supported by AWS Batch at the time the infrastructure update is initiated. Alternatively you can specify the AMI ID in the ``ImageId`` or ``ImageIdOverride`` properties, or the launch template identified by the ``LaunchTemplate`` properties. Changing any of these properties will trigger an infrastructure update.

       If these rules are followed, any update that triggers an infrastructure update will cause the AMI ID to be re-selected. If the `Version <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-launchtemplatespecification.html#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-launchtemplatespecification-version>`_ property of the `LaunchTemplateSpecification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-batch-computeenvironment-launchtemplatespecification.html>`_ is set to ``$Latest`` or ``$Default`` , the latest or default version of the launch template will be evaluated up at the time of the infrastructure update, even if the ``LaunchTemplateSpecification`` was not updated.

        :param service_role: The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf. For more information, see `AWS Batch service IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: If your account already created the AWS Batch service-linked role, that role is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a different role here.

If your specified role has a path other than ``/`` , then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name ``bar`` has a path of ``/foo/`` then you would specify ``/foo/bar`` as the role name. For more information, see `Friendly names and paths <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names>`_ in the *IAM User Guide* . .. epigraph:: Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN might contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
        :param state: The state of the compute environment. If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues. If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is ``DISABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the ``DISABLED`` state don't scale out. However, they scale in to ``minvCpus`` value after instances become idle.
        :param tags: The tags applied to the compute environment.
        :param unmanagedv_cpus: The maximum number of vCPUs for an unmanaged compute environment. This parameter is only used for fair share scheduling to reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for a fair share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved. .. epigraph:: This parameter is only supported when the ``type`` parameter is set to ``UNMANAGED`` .

            '''Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment.

            This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

            :param maxv_cpus: The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment can reach. .. epigraph:: With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` allocation strategies, AWS Batch might need to exceed ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance. That is, no more than a single instance from among those specified in your compute environment.
            :param subnets: The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For Fargate compute resources, providing an empty list will be handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made. For EC2 compute resources, providing an empty list removes the VPC subnets from the compute resource. For more information, see `VPCs and subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html>`_ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* . When updating a compute environment, changing the VPC subnets requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
            :param type: The type of compute environment: ``EC2`` , ``SPOT`` , ``FARGATE`` , or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` . For more information, see `Compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . If you choose ``SPOT`` , you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the ``spotIamFleetRole`` parameter. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 spot fleet role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . When updating compute environment, changing the type of a compute environment requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . When updating the type of a compute environment, changing between ``EC2`` and ``SPOT`` or between ``FARGATE`` and ``FARGATE_SPOT`` will initiate an infrastructure update, but if you switch between ``EC2`` and ``FARGATE`` , AWS CloudFormation will create a new compute environment.
            :param allocation_strategy: The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`_ . For more information, see `Allocation strategies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . ``BEST_FIT`` is not supported when updating a compute environment. .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. - **BEST_FIT (default)** - AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is reaching `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`_ then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with ``BEST_FIT`` then the Spot Fleet IAM role must be specified. - **BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE** - AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, AWS Batch will select new instance types. - **SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED** - AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources. With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance.
            :param bid_percentage: The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. When updating a compute environment, changing the bid percentage requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param desiredv_cpus: The desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. AWS Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values based on job queue demand. .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param ec2_configuration: Provides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for EC2 instances in the compute environment. If ``Ec2Configuration`` isn't specified, the default is ``ECS_AL2`` . When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . To remove the EC2 configuration and any custom AMI ID specified in ``imageIdOverride`` , set this value to an empty string. One or two values can be provided. .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param ec2_key_pair: The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH. To remove the Amazon EC2 key pair, set this value to an empty string. When updating a compute environment, changing the EC2 key pair requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param image_id: The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the ``imageIdOverride`` member of the ``Ec2Configuration`` structure. To remove the custom AMI ID and use the default AMI ID, set this value to an empty string. When updating a compute environment, changing the AMI ID requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. > The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see `Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux-variants.html>`_ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
            :param instance_role: The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, ``*ecsInstanceRole*`` or ``arn:aws:iam:: *<aws_account_id>* :instance-profile/ *ecsInstanceRole*`` . For more information, see `Amazon ECS instance role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param instance_types: The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, ``c5`` or ``p3`` ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as ``c5.8xlarge`` ). You can also choose ``optimal`` to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues. When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. > When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment. > Currently, ``optimal`` uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.
            :param launch_template: The launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a `CreateComputeEnvironment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_CreateComputeEnvironment.html>`_ API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. For more information, see `Launch Template Support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the ** . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param minv_cpus: The minimum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is ``DISABLED`` ). .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param placement_group: The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see `Placement groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . When updating a compute environment, changing the placement group requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param security_group_ids: The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is required for Fargate compute resources, where it can contain up to 5 security groups. For Fargate compute resources, providing an empty list is handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made. For EC2 compute resources, providing an empty list removes the security groups from the compute resource. When updating a compute environment, changing the EC2 security groups requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
            :param spot_iam_fleet_role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a ``SPOT`` compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to ``BEST_FIT`` or if the allocation strategy isn't specified. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 spot fleet role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified. > To tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet IAM role specified here must use the newer *AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole* managed policy. The previously recommended *AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole* managed policy doesn't have the required permissions to tag Spot Instances. For more information, see `Spot instances not tagged on creation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#spot-instance-no-tag>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
            :param tags: Key-value pair tags to be applied to EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For AWS Batch , these take the form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value−for example, ``{ "Name": "Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" }`` . This is helpful for recognizing your AWS Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags aren't seen when using the AWS Batch ``ListTagsForResource`` API operation. When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
            :param update_to_latest_image_version: Specifies whether the AMI ID is updated to the latest one that's supported by AWS Batch when the compute environment has an infrastructure update. The default value is ``false`` . .. epigraph:: If an AMI ID is specified in the ``imageId`` or ``imageIdOverride`` parameters or by the launch template specified in the ``launchTemplate`` parameter, this parameter is ignored. For more information on updating AMI IDs during an infrastructure update, see `Updating the AMI ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html#updating-compute-environments-ami>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

            When updating a compute environment, changing the allocation strategy requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . ``BEST_FIT`` is not supported when updating a compute environment.

               This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

            - **BEST_FIT (default)** - AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is reaching `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`_ then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with ``BEST_FIT`` then the Spot Fleet IAM role must be specified.
            - **BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE** - AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.
            - **SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED** - AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

            With both ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE`` and ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance.

For example, if a role with the name ``bar`` has a path of ``/foo/`` then you would specify ``/foo/bar`` as the role name. For more information, see `Friendly names and paths <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names>`_ in the *IAM User Guide* . .. epigraph:: Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN might contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
        :param state: The state of the compute environment. If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues. If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is ``DISABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the ``DISABLED`` state don't scale out. However, they scale in to ``minvCpus`` value after instances become idle.
        :param tags: The tags applied to the compute environment.
        :param unmanagedv_cpus: The maximum number of vCPUs for an unmanaged compute environment. This parameter is only used for fair share scheduling to reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for a fair share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved. .. epigraph:: This parameter is only supported when the ``type`` parameter is set to ``UNMANAGED`` .
        :param update_policy: Specifies the infrastructure update policy for the compute environment. For more information about infrastructure updates, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`_ in the Docker documentation. .. epigraph:: AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the ``LogConfiguration`` data type). This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"`` .. epigraph:: The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options.

            :param memory: This parameter is deprecated, use ``resourceRequirements`` to specify the memory requirements for the job definition. It's not supported for jobs running on Fargate resources. For jobs running on EC2 resources, it specifies the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to exceed the specified number, it's terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be specified in several places. It must be specified for each node at least once.

This parameter maps to ``Volumes`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`_ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`_ and the ``--volume`` option to `docker run <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`_ .
            :param network_configuration: The network configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.
            :param privileged: When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated permissions on the host container instance (similar to the ``root`` user).

            :param readonly_root_filesystem: When this parameter is true, the container is given read-only access to its root file system. This parameter maps to ``ReadonlyRootfs`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container>`_ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/>`_ and the ``--read-only`` option to ``docker run`` .

However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see `Configure logging drivers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/>`_ in the Docker documentation.

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnJobDefinition``.

        :param type: The type of job definition. For more information about multi-node parallel jobs, see `Creating a multi-node parallel job definition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-node-job-def.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* . .. epigraph:: If the job is run on Fargate resources, then ``multinode`` isn't supported.
        :param container_properties: An object with various properties specific to container-based jobs.
        :param job_definition_name: The name of the job definition.
        :param node_properties: An object with various properties specific to multi-node parallel jobs. .. epigraph:: If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not specify ``nodeProperties`` ; use ``containerProperties`` instead.
        :param parameters: Default parameters or parameter substitution placeholders that are set in the job definition. Parameters are specified as a key-value pair mapping. Parameters in a ``SubmitJob`` request override any corresponding parameter defaults from the job definition. For more information about specifying parameters, see `Job definition parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_definition_parameters.html>`_ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
        :param platform_capabilities: The platform capabilities required by the job definition. If no value is specified, it defaults to ``EC2`` . Jobs run on Fargate resources specify ``FARGATE`` .
        :param propagate_tags: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the ``FAILED`` state.
        :param retry_strategy: The retry strategy to use for failed jobs that are submitted with this job definition.
        :param scheduling_priority: The scheduling priority of the job definition. This only affects jobs in job queues with a fair share policy. Jobs with a higher scheduling priority are scheduled before jobs with a lower scheduling priority.
        :param tags: The tags applied to the job definition.
        :param timeout: The timeout configuration for jobs that are submitted with this job definition. You can specify a timeout duration after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they haven't finished.

        :param vpc: (experimental) The VPC network that all compute resources will be connected to.
        :param allocation_strategy: (experimental) The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource in case not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This could be due to availability of the instance type in the region or Amazon EC2 service limits. If this is not specified, the default for the EC2 ComputeResourceType is BEST_FIT, which will use only the best fitting instance type, waiting for additional capacity if it's not available. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified. BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE will select an additional instance type that is large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for an instance type with a lower cost. The default value for the SPOT instance type is SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED, which is only available for for this type of compute resources and will select an additional instance type that is large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for an instance type that is less likely to be interrupted. Default: AllocationStrategy.BEST_FIT
        :param bid_percentage: (experimental) This property will be ignored if you set the environment type to ON_DEMAND. The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be below 20% of the current On-Demand price for that EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price. Default: 100
        :param compute_resources_tags: (experimental) Key-value pair tags to be applied to resources that are launched in the compute environment. For AWS Batch, these take the form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value—for example, { "Name": "AWS Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" }. Default: - no tags will be assigned on compute resources.
        :param desiredv_cpus: (experimental) The desired number of EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. Default: - no desired vcpu value will be used.
        :param ec2_key_pair: (experimental) The EC2 key pair that is used for instances launched in the compute environment. If no key is defined, then SSH access is not allowed to provisioned compute resources. Default: - no SSH access will be possible.
        :param image: (experimental) The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. Default: - no image will be used.
        :param instance_role: (experimental) The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, ecsInstanceRole or arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole . For more information, see Amazon ECS Instance Role in the AWS Batch User Guide. Default: - a new role will be created.
        :param instance_types: (experimental) The types of EC2 instances that may be launched in the compute environment. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, c4 or p3), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as c4.8xlarge). You can also choose optimal to pick instance types (from the C, M, and R instance families) on the fly that match the demand of your job queues. Default: optimal
        :param launch_template: (experimental) An optional launch template to associate with your compute resources. For more information, see README file. Default: - no custom launch template will be used
        :param maxv_cpus: (experimental) The maximum number of EC2 vCPUs that an environment can reach. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. You must specify at least one vCPU. Default: 256
        :param minv_cpus: (experimental) The minimum number of EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment state is DISABLED). Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. By keeping this set to 0 you will not have instance time wasted when there is no work to be run. If you set this above zero you will maintain that number of vCPUs at all times. Default: 0
        :param placement_group: (experimental) The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. Default: - No placement group will be used.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) The EC2 security group(s) associated with instances launched in the compute environment. Default: - AWS default security group.
        :param spot_fleet_role: (experimental) This property will be ignored if you set the environment type to ON_DEMAND. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a SPOT compute environment. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role in the AWS Batch User Guide. Default: - no fleet role will be used.
        :param type: (experimental) The type of compute environment: ON_DEMAND, SPOT, FARGATE, or FARGATE_SPOT. Default: ON_DEMAND
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched. Default: - private subnets of the supplied VPC.
