# Amazon Lambda Golang Library

This library provides constructs for Golang Lambda functions.

To use this module you will either need to have `Go` installed (`go1.11` or later) or `Docker` installed.
See [Local Bundling](#local-bundling)/[Docker Bundling](#docker-bundling) for more information.

This module also requires that your Golang application is
using a Go version >= 1.11 and is using [Go modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod).

## Go Function

Define a `GoFunction`:

```python
lambda_.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api"
)
```

By default, if `entry` points to a directory, then the construct will assume there is a Go entry file (i.e. `main.go`).
Let's look at an example Go project:

```bash
lamda-app
├── cmd
│   └── api
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── pkg
│   ├── auth
│   │   └── auth.go
│   └── middleware
│       └── middleware.go
└── vendor
    ├── github.com
    │   └── aws
    │       └── aws-lambda-go
    └── modules.txt
```

With the above layout I could either provide the `entry` as `lambda-app/cmd/api` or `lambda-app/cmd/api/main.go`, either will work.
When the construct builds the golang binary this will be translated `go build ./cmd/api` & `go build ./cmd/api/main.go` respectively.
The construct will figure out where it needs to run the `go build` command from, in this example it would be from
the `lambda-app` directory. It does this by determining the [mod file path](#mod-file-path), which is explained in the
next section.

### mod file path

The `GoFunction` tries to automatically determine your project root, that is
the root of your golang project. This is usually where the top level `go.mod` file or
`vendor` folder of your project is located. When bundling in a Docker container, the
`moduleDir` is used as the source (`/asset-input`) for the volume mounted in
the container.

The CDK will walk up parent folders starting from
the current working directory until it finds a folder containing a `go.mod` file.

Alternatively, you can specify the `moduleDir` prop manually. In this case you
need to ensure that this path includes `entry` and any module/dependencies used
by your function. Otherwise bundling will fail.

## Runtime

The `GoFunction` can be used with either the `GO_1_X` runtime or the provided runtimes (`PROVIDED`/`PROVIDED_AL2`).
By default it will use the `PROVIDED_AL2` runtime. The `GO_1_X` runtime does not support things like
[Lambda Extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/using-extensions.html), whereas the provided runtimes do.
The [aws-lambda-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go) library has built in support for the provided runtime as long as
you name the handler `bootstrap` (which we do by default).

## Dependencies

The construct will attempt to figure out how to handle the dependencies for your function. It will
do this by determining whether or not you are vendoring your dependencies. It makes this determination
by looking to see if there is a `vendor` folder at the [mod file path](#mod-file-path).

With this information the construct can determine what commands to run. You will
generally fall into two scenarios:

1. You are using vendoring (indicated by the presence of a `vendor` folder)
   In this case `go build` will be run with `-mod=vendor` set
2. You are not using vendoring (indicated by the absence of a `vendor` folder)
   If you are not vendoring then `go build` will be run without `-mod=vendor`
   since the default behavior is to download dependencies

All other properties of `lambda.Function` are supported, see also the [AWS Lambda construct library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-lambda).

## Environment

By default the following environment variables are set for you:

* `GOOS=linux`
* `GOARCH`: based on the target architecture of the Lambda function
* `GO111MODULE=on`

Use the `environment` prop to define additional environment variables when go runs:

```python
lambda_.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_go.BundlingOptions(
        environment={
            "HELLO": "WORLD"
        }
    )
)
```

## Local Bundling

If `Go` is installed locally and the version is >= `go1.11` then it will be used to bundle your code in your environment. Otherwise, bundling will happen in a [Lambda compatible Docker container](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sam/build-go1.x) with the Docker platform based on the target architecture of the Lambda function.

For macOS the recommended approach is to install `Go` as Docker volume performance is really poor.

`Go` can be installed by following the [installation docs](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Docker

To force bundling in a docker container even if `Go` is available in your environment, set the `forceDockerBundling` prop to `true`. This is useful if you want to make sure that your function is built in a consistent Lambda compatible environment.

Use the `buildArgs` prop to pass build arguments when building the bundling image:

```python
lambda_.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_go.BundlingOptions(
        build_args={
            "HTTPS_PROXY": "https://127.0.0.1:3001"
        }
    )
)
```

Use the `bundling.dockerImage` prop to use a custom bundling image:

```python
lambda_.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_go.BundlingOptions(
        docker_image=DockerImage.from_build("/path/to/Dockerfile")
    )
)
```

Use the `bundling.goBuildFlags` prop to pass additional build flags to `go build`:

```python
lambda_.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_go.BundlingOptions(
        go_build_flags=["-ldflags \"-s -w\""]
    )
)
```

## Command hooks

It is  possible to run additional commands by specifying the `commandHooks` prop:

```text
// This example only available in TypeScript
// Run additional commands on a GoFunction via `commandHooks` property
new lambda.GoFunction(this, 'handler', {
  bundling: {
    commandHooks: {
      // run tests
      beforeBundling(inputDir: string): string[] {
        return ['go test ./cmd/api -v'];
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
});
```

The following hooks are available:

* `beforeBundling`: runs before all bundling commands
* `afterBundling`: runs after all bundling commands

They all receive the directory containing the `go.mod` file (`inputDir`) and the
directory where the bundled asset will be output (`outputDir`). They must return
an array of commands to run. Commands are chained with `&&`.

The commands will run in the environment in which bundling occurs: inside the
container for Docker bundling or on the host OS for local bundling.

## Additional considerations

Depending on how you structure your Golang application, you may want to change the `assetHashType` parameter.
By default this parameter is set to `AssetHashType.OUTPUT` which means that the CDK will calculate the asset hash
(and determine whether or not your code has changed) based on the Golang executable that is created.

If you specify `AssetHashType.SOURCE`, the CDK will calculate the asset hash by looking at the folder
that contains your `go.mod` file. If you are deploying a single Lambda function, or you want to redeploy
all of your functions if anything changes, then `AssetHashType.SOURCE` will probaby work.

For example, if my app looked like this:

```bash
lamda-app
├── cmd
│   └── api
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── pkg
    └── auth
        └── auth.go
```

With this structure I would provide the `entry` as `cmd/api` which means that the CDK
will determine that the protect root is `lambda-app` (it contains the `go.mod` file).
Since I only have a single Lambda function, and any update to files within the `lambda-app` directory
should trigger a new deploy, I could specify `AssetHashType.SOURCE`.

On the other hand, if I had a project that deployed mmultiple Lambda functions, for example:

```bash
lamda-app
├── cmd
│   ├── api
│   │   └── main.go
│   └── anotherApi
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── pkg
    ├── auth
    │   └── auth.go
    └── middleware
        └── middleware.go
```

Then I would most likely want `AssetHashType.OUTPUT`. With `OUTPUT`
the CDK will only recognize changes if the Golang executable has changed,
and Go only includes dependencies that are used in the executable. So in this case
if `cmd/api` used the `auth` & `middleware` packages, but `cmd/anotherApi` did not, then
an update to `auth` or `middleware` would only trigger an update to the `cmd/api` Lambda
Function.

If a directory path is provided then it will assume there is a Go entry file (i.e. ``main.go``) and will construct the build command using the directory path. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api` If a path to a file is provided then it will use the filepath in the build command. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api/main.go' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api/main.go`
        :param bundling: (experimental) Bundling options. Default: - use default bundling options
        :param module_dir: (experimental) Directory containing your go.mod file. This will accept either a directory path containing a ``go.mod`` file or a filepath to your ``go.mod`` file (i.e. ``path/to/go.mod``). This will be used as the source of the volume mounted in the Docker container and will be the directory where it will run ``go build`` from. Default: - the path is found by walking up parent directories searching for a ``go.mod`` file from the location of ``entry``

        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: (experimental) Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: (experimental) The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: (experimental) A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: (experimental) Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions.

Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: (experimental) The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: (experimental) The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: (experimental) Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: (experimental) The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: (experimental) A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: (experimental) Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: (experimental) Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param layers: (experimental) A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: (experimental) When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.

        :param memory_size: (experimental) The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param profiling: (experimental) Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: (experimental) Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: (experimental) The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: (experimental) Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param security_group: (deprecated) What security group to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. This property is being deprecated, consider using securityGroups instead. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Use securityGroups property instead. Function constructor will throw an error if both are specified. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroups prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param timeout: (experimental) The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: (experimental) Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Note: internet access for Lambdas requires a NAT gateway, so picking Public subnets is not allowed. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: (experimental) The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: (experimental) The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: (experimental) The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination

        :param tracing: (experimental) Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Note: internet access for Lambdas requires a NAT gateway, so picking Public subnets is not allowed. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param entry: (experimental) The path to the folder or file that contains the main application entry point files for the project. This accepts either a path to a directory or file. If a directory path is provided then it will assume there is a Go entry file (i.e. ``main.go``) and will construct the build command using the directory path. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api` If a path to a file is provided then it will use the filepath in the build command. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api/main.go' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api/main.go`
        :param bundling: (experimental) Bundling options. Default: - use default bundling options
        :param module_dir: (experimental) Directory containing your go.mod file. This will accept either a directory path containing a ``go.mod`` file or a filepath to your ``go.mod`` file (i.e. ``path/to/go.mod``). This will be used as the source of the volume mounted in the Docker container and will be the directory where it will run ``go build`` from. Default: - the path is found by walking up parent directories searching for a ``go.mod`` file from the location of ``entry``
        :param runtime: (experimental) The runtime environment. Only runtimes of the Golang family and provided family are supported. Default: lambda.Runtime.PROVIDED_AL2
