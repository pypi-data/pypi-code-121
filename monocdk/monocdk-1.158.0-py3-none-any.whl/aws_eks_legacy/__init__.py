# Amazon EKS Construct Library

**This module is available for backwards compatibility purposes only ([details](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/5540)). It will
no longer be released with the CDK starting March 1st, 2020. See [issue

## 5544](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/5544) for upgrade instructions.**

---


This construct library allows you to define [Amazon Elastic Container Service
for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) clusters programmatically.
This library also supports programmatically defining Kubernetes resource
manifests within EKS clusters.

This example defines an Amazon EKS cluster with the following configuration:

* 2x **m5.large** instances (this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money)
* Dedicated VPC with default configuration (see [ec2.Vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html#vpc))
* A Kubernetes pod with a container based on the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes) image.

```python
cluster = eks.Cluster(self, "hello-eks")

cluster.add_resource("mypod", {
    "api_version": "v1",
    "kind": "Pod",
    "metadata": {"name": "mypod"},
    "spec": {
        "containers": [{
            "name": "hello",
            "image": "paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5",
            "ports": [{"container_port": 8080}]
        }
        ]
    }
})
```

Here is a [complete sample](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/packages/@aws-cdk/aws-eks-legacy/test/integ.eks-kubectl.lit.ts).

### Capacity

By default, `eks.Cluster` is created with x2 `m5.large` instances.

```python
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster-two-m5-large")
```

The quantity and instance type for the default capacity can be specified through
the `defaultCapacity` and `defaultCapacityInstance` props:

```python
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster",
    default_capacity=10,
    default_capacity_instance=ec2.InstanceType("m2.xlarge")
)
```

To disable the default capacity, simply set `defaultCapacity` to `0`:

```python
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster-with-no-capacity", default_capacity=0)
```

The `cluster.defaultCapacity` property will reference the `AutoScalingGroup`
resource for the default capacity. It will be `undefined` if `defaultCapacity`
is set to `0`:

```python
cluster = eks.Cluster(self, "my-cluster")
cluster.default_capacity.scale_on_cpu_utilization("up",
    target_utilization_percent=80
)
```

You can add customized capacity through `cluster.addCapacity()` or
`cluster.addAutoScalingGroup()`:

```python
# cluster: eks.Cluster

cluster.add_capacity("frontend-nodes",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.medium"),
    desired_capacity=3,
    vpc_subnets=eks.aws_ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC)
)
```

### Spot Capacity

If `spotPrice` is specified, the capacity will be purchased from spot instances:

```python
# cluster: eks.Cluster

cluster.add_capacity("spot",
    spot_price="0.1094",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t3.large"),
    max_capacity=10
)
```

Spot instance nodes will be labeled with `lifecycle=Ec2Spot` and tainted with `PreferNoSchedule`.

The [Spot Termination Handler](https://github.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-labs/tree/master/ec2-spot-eks-solution/spot-termination-handler)
DaemonSet will be installed on these nodes. The termination handler leverages
[EC2 Spot Instance Termination Notices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-spot-instance-termination-notices/)
to gracefully stop all pods running on spot nodes that are about to be
terminated.

### Bootstrapping

When adding capacity, you can specify options for
[/etc/eks/boostrap.sh](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/bootstrap.sh)
which is responsible for associating the node to the EKS cluster. For example,
you can use `kubeletExtraArgs` to add custom node labels or taints.

```python
# up to ten spot instances
# cluster: eks.Cluster

cluster.add_capacity("spot",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t3.large"),
    desired_capacity=2,
    bootstrap_options=eks.aws_eks_legacy.BootstrapOptions(
        kubelet_extra_args="--node-labels foo=bar,goo=far",
        aws_api_retry_attempts=5
    )
)
```

To disable bootstrapping altogether (i.e. to fully customize user-data), set `bootstrapEnabled` to `false` when you add
the capacity.

### Masters Role

The Amazon EKS construct library allows you to specify an IAM role that will be
granted `system:masters` privileges on your cluster.

Without specifying a `mastersRole`, you will not be able to interact manually
with the cluster.

The following example defines an IAM role that can be assumed by all users
in the account and shows how to use the `mastersRole` property to map this
role to the Kubernetes `system:masters` group:

```python
# first define the role
cluster_admin = iam.Role(self, "AdminRole",
    assumed_by=iam.AccountRootPrincipal()
)

# now define the cluster and map role to "masters" RBAC group
eks.Cluster(self, "Cluster",
    masters_role=cluster_admin
)
```

When you `cdk deploy` this CDK app, you will notice that an output will be printed
with the `update-kubeconfig` command.

Something like this:

```plaintext
Outputs:
eks-integ-defaults.ClusterConfigCommand43AAE40F = aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-ba7c166b-c4f3-421c-bf8a-6812e4036a33 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/eks-integ-defaults-Role1ABCC5F0-1EFK2W5ZJD98Y
```

Copy & paste the "`aws eks update-kubeconfig ...`" command to your shell in
order to connect to your EKS cluster with the "masters" role.

Now, given [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is configured to use AWS
credentials for a user that is trusted by the masters role, you should be able
to interact with your cluster through `kubectl` (the above example will trust
all users in the account).

For example:

```console
$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-ba7c166b-c4f3-421c-bf8a-6812e4036a33 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/eks-integ-defaults-Role1ABCC5F0-1EFK2W5ZJD98Y
Added new context arn:aws:eks:eu-west-2:112233445566:cluster/cluster-ba7c166b-c4f3-421c-bf8a-6812e4036a33 to /Users/boom/.kube/config

```

For your convenience, an AWS CloudFormation output will automatically be
included in your template and will be printed when running `cdk deploy`.

**NOTE**: if the cluster is configured with `kubectlEnabled: false`, it
will be created with the role/user that created the AWS CloudFormation
stack. See [Kubectl Support](#kubectl-support) for details.

### Kubernetes Resources

The `KubernetesResource` construct or `cluster.addResource` method can be used
to apply Kubernetes resource manifests to this cluster.

The following examples will deploy the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes)
service on the cluster:

```python
# cluster: eks.Cluster
app_label = {"app": "hello-kubernetes"}

deployment = {
    "api_version": "apps/v1",
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "metadata": {"name": "hello-kubernetes"},
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 3,
        "selector": {"match_labels": app_label},
        "template": {
            "metadata": {"labels": app_label},
            "spec": {
                "containers": [{
                    "name": "hello-kubernetes",
                    "image": "paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5",
                    "ports": [{"container_port": 8080}]
                }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

service = {
    "api_version": "v1",
    "kind": "Service",
    "metadata": {"name": "hello-kubernetes"},
    "spec": {
        "type": "LoadBalancer",
        "ports": [{"port": 80, "target_port": 8080}],
        "selector": app_label
    }
}
# option 1: use a construct
eks.KubernetesResource(self, "hello-kub",
    cluster=cluster,
    manifest=[deployment, service]
)

# or, option2: use `addResource`
cluster.add_resource("hello-kub", service, deployment)
```

Since Kubernetes resources are implemented as CloudFormation resources in the
CDK. This means that if the resource is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `kubectl delete` command and the
Kubernetes resources will be deleted.

### AWS IAM Mapping

As described in the [Amazon EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html),
you can map AWS IAM users and roles to [Kubernetes Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac).

The Amazon EKS construct manages the **aws-auth ConfigMap** Kubernetes resource
on your behalf and exposes an API through the `cluster.awsAuth` for mapping
users, roles and accounts.

Furthermore, when auto-scaling capacity is added to the cluster (through
`cluster.addCapacity` or `cluster.addAutoScalingGroup`), the IAM instance role
of the auto-scaling group will be automatically mapped to RBAC so nodes can
connect to the cluster. No manual mapping is required any longer.

> NOTE: `cluster.awsAuth` will throw an error if your cluster is created with `kubectlEnabled: false`.

For example, let's say you want to grant an IAM user administrative privileges
on your cluster:

```python
# cluster: eks.Cluster

admin_user = iam.User(self, "Admin")
cluster.aws_auth.add_user_mapping(admin_user, groups=["system:masters"])
```

A convenience method for mapping a role to the `system:masters` group is also available:

```python
# cluster: eks.Cluster
# role: iam.Role

cluster.aws_auth.add_masters_role(role)
```

### Node ssh Access

If you want to be able to SSH into your worker nodes, you must already
have an SSH key in the region you're connecting to and pass it, and you must
be able to connect to the hosts (meaning they must have a public IP and you
should be allowed to connect to them on port 22):

```python
asg = cluster.add_capacity("Nodes",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.medium"),
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC),
    key_name="my-key-name"
)

# Replace with desired IP
asg.connections.allow_from(ec2.Peer.ipv4("1.2.3.4/32"), ec2.Port.tcp(22))
```

If you want to SSH into nodes in a private subnet, you should set up a
bastion host in a public subnet. That setup is recommended, but is
unfortunately beyond the scope of this documentation.

### kubectl Support

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, the IAM entity user or role, such as a
[federated user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html)
that creates the cluster, is automatically granted `system:masters` permissions
in the cluster's RBAC configuration.

In order to allow programmatically defining **Kubernetes resources** in your AWS
CDK app and provisioning them through AWS CloudFormation, we will need to assume
this "masters" role every time we want to issue `kubectl` operations against your
cluster.

At the moment, the [AWS::EKS::Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-eks-cluster.html)
AWS CloudFormation resource does not support this behavior, so in order to
support "programmatic kubectl", such as applying manifests
and mapping IAM roles from within your CDK application, the Amazon EKS
construct library uses a custom resource for provisioning the cluster.
This custom resource is executed with an IAM role that we can then use
to issue `kubectl` commands.

The default behavior of this library is to use this custom resource in order
to retain programmatic control over the cluster. In other words: to allow
you to define Kubernetes resources in your CDK code instead of having to
manage your Kubernetes applications through a separate system.

One of the implications of this design is that, by default, the user who
provisioned the AWS CloudFormation stack (executed `cdk deploy`) will
not have administrative privileges on the EKS cluster.

1. Additional resources will be synthesized into your template (the AWS Lambda
   function, the role and policy).
2. As described in [Interacting with Your Cluster](#interacting-with-your-cluster),
   if you wish to be able to manually interact with your cluster, you will need
   to map an IAM role or user to the `system:masters` group. This can be either
   done by specifying a `mastersRole` when the cluster is defined, calling
   `cluster.awsAuth.addMastersRole` or explicitly mapping an IAM role or IAM user to the
   relevant Kubernetes RBAC groups using `cluster.addRoleMapping` and/or
   `cluster.addUserMapping`.

If you wish to disable the programmatic kubectl behavior and use the standard
AWS::EKS::Cluster resource, you can specify `kubectlEnabled: false` when you define
the cluster:

```python
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster",
    kubectl_enabled=False
)
```

**Take care**: a change in this property will cause the cluster to be destroyed
and a new cluster to be created.

When kubectl is disabled, you should be aware of the following:

1. When you log-in to your cluster, you don't need to specify `--role-arn` as
   long as you are using the same user that created the cluster.
2. As described in the Amazon EKS User Guide, you will need to manually
   edit the [aws-auth ConfigMap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html)
   when you add capacity in order to map the IAM instance role to RBAC to allow nodes to join the cluster.
3. Any `eks.Cluster` APIs that depend on programmatic kubectl support will fail
   with an error: `cluster.addResource`, `cluster.addChart`, `cluster.awsAuth`, `props.mastersRole`.

### Helm Charts

The `HelmChart` construct or `cluster.addChart` method can be used
to add Kubernetes resources to this cluster using Helm.

The following example will install the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)
to you cluster using Helm.

```python
# cluster: eks.Cluster

# option 1: use a construct
eks.HelmChart(self, "NginxIngress",
    cluster=cluster,
    chart="nginx-ingress",
    repository="https://helm.nginx.com/stable",
    namespace="kube-system"
)

# or, option2: use `addChart`
cluster.add_chart("NginxIngress",
    chart="nginx-ingress",
    repository="https://helm.nginx.com/stable",
    namespace="kube-system"
)
```

Helm charts will be installed and updated using `helm upgrade --install`.
This means that if the chart is added to CDK with the same release name, it will try to update
the chart in the cluster. The chart will exists as CloudFormation resource.

Helm charts are implemented as CloudFormation resources in CDK.
This means that if the chart is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `helm uninstall` command and the
Helm chart will be deleted.

When there is no `release` defined, the chart will be installed with a unique name allocated
based on the construct path.

        :param auto_scaling_group_name: (experimental) The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. Default: - Auto generated by CloudFormation
        :param block_devices: (experimental) Specifies how block devices are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes. Each instance that is launched has an associated root device volume, either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume. You can use block device mappings to specify additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it is launched. Default: - Uses the block device mapping of the AMI
        :param cooldown: (experimental) Default scaling cooldown for this AutoScalingGroup. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param desired_capacity: (experimental) Initial amount of instances in the fleet. If this is set to a number, every deployment will reset the amount of instances to this number. It is recommended to leave this value blank. Default: minCapacity, and leave unchanged during deployment
        :param group_metrics: (experimental) Enable monitoring for group metrics, these metrics describe the group rather than any of its instances. To report all group metrics use ``GroupMetrics.all()`` Group metrics are reported in a granularity of 1 minute at no additional charge. Default: - no group metrics will be reported
        :param health_check: (experimental) Configuration for health checks. Default: - HealthCheck.ec2 with no grace period
        :param ignore_unmodified_size_properties: (experimental) If the ASG has scheduled actions, don't reset unchanged group sizes. Only used if the ASG has scheduled actions (which may scale your ASG up or down regardless of cdk deployments). If true, the size of the group will only be reset if it has been changed in the CDK app. If false, the sizes will always be changed back to what they were in the CDK app on deployment. Default: true
        :param instance_monitoring: (experimental) Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed or basic monitoring. When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. Default: - Monitoring.DETAILED
        :param key_name: (experimental) Name of SSH keypair to grant access to instances. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param max_capacity: (experimental) Maximum number of instances in the fleet. Default: desiredCapacity
        :param max_instance_lifetime: (experimental) The maximum amount of time that an instance can be in service. The maximum duration applies to all current and future instances in the group. As an instance approaches its maximum duration, it is terminated and replaced, and cannot be used again. You must specify a value of at least 604,800 seconds (7 days). To clear a previously set value, leave this property undefined. Default: none
        :param min_capacity: (experimental) Minimum number of instances in the fleet. Default: 1
        :param new_instances_protected_from_scale_in: (experimental) Whether newly-launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. By default, Auto Scaling can terminate an instance at any time after launch when scaling in an Auto Scaling Group, subject to the group's termination policy. However, you may wish to protect newly-launched instances from being scaled in if they are going to run critical applications that should not be prematurely terminated. This flag must be enabled if the Auto Scaling Group will be associated with an ECS Capacity Provider with managed termination protection. Default: false
        :param notifications: (experimental) Configure autoscaling group to send notifications about fleet changes to an SNS topic(s). Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param notifications_topic: (deprecated) SNS topic to send notifications about fleet changes. Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param replacing_update_min_successful_instances_percent: (deprecated) Configuration for replacing updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.ReplacingUpdate. Specifies how many instances must signal success for the update to succeed. Default: minSuccessfulInstancesPercent
        :param resource_signal_count: (deprecated) How many ResourceSignal calls CloudFormation expects before the resource is considered created. Default: 1 if resourceSignalTimeout is set, 0 otherwise
        :param resource_signal_timeout: (deprecated) The length of time to wait for the resourceSignalCount. The maximum value is 43200 (12 hours). Default: Duration.minutes(5) if resourceSignalCount is set, N/A otherwise
        :param rolling_update_configuration: (deprecated) Configuration for rolling updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.RollingUpdate. Default: - RollingUpdateConfiguration with defaults.
        :param signals: (experimental) Configure waiting for signals during deployment. Use this to pause the CloudFormation deployment to wait for the instances in the AutoScalingGroup to report successful startup during creation and updates. The UserData script needs to invoke ``cfn-signal`` with a success or failure code after it is done setting up the instance. Without waiting for signals, the CloudFormation deployment will proceed as soon as the AutoScalingGroup has been created or updated but before the instances in the group have been started. For example, to have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script.

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::EKS::Cluster``.

    Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.

    The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as ``etcd`` and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS , and the Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.

    The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support ``kubectl exec`` , ``logs`` , and ``proxy`` data flows).

    Amazon EKS nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.

    In most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster. For more information, see `Managing Cluster Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-auth.html>`_ and `Launching Amazon EKS nodes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

               When updating a resource, you must include these properties if the previous CloudFormation template of the resource had them:

               - ``EndpointPublicAccess``
               - ``EndpointPrivateAccess``
               - ``PublicAccessCidrs``

            :param subnet_ids: Specify subnets for your Amazon EKS nodes. Amazon EKS creates cross-account elastic network interfaces in these subnets to allow communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.
            :param endpoint_private_access: Set this value to ``true`` to enable private access for your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you enable private access, Kubernetes API requests from within your cluster's VPC use the private VPC endpoint. The default value for this parameter is ``false`` , which disables private access for your Kubernetes API server. If you disable private access and you have nodes or AWS Fargate pods in the cluster, then ensure that ``publicAccessCidrs`` includes the necessary CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods. For more information, see `Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html>`_ in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** .
            :param endpoint_public_access: Set this value to ``false`` to disable public access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you disable public access, your cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive requests from within the cluster VPC. The default value for this parameter is ``true`` , which enables public access for your Kubernetes API server. For more information, see `Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html>`_ in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** .
            :param public_access_cidrs: The CIDR blocks that are allowed access to your cluster's public Kubernetes API server endpoint. Communication to the endpoint from addresses outside of the CIDR blocks that you specify is denied. The default value is ``0.0.0.0/0`` . If you've disabled private endpoint access and you have nodes or AWS Fargate pods in the cluster, then ensure that you specify the necessary CIDR blocks. For more information, see `Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html>`_ in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** .
            :param security_group_ids: Specify one or more security groups for the cross-account elastic network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates to use that allow communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane. If you don't specify any security groups, then familiarize yourself with the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for clusters deployed with Kubernetes: - 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version ``eks.2`` and earlier - 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version ``eks.3`` and later For more information, see `Amazon EKS security group considerations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html>`_ in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** .

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::EKS::FargateProfile``.

    Creates an AWS Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate.

    The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile’s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.

    When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes `Role Based Access Control <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/>`_ (RBAC) for authorization so that the ``kubelet`` that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see `Pod Execution Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

    Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating.

    If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the ``DELETING`` status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster.

    For more information, see `AWS Fargate Profile <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

For more information about using launch templates, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ .

    An Amazon EKS managed node group is an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and associated Amazon EC2 instances that are managed by AWS for an Amazon EKS cluster. Each node group uses a version of the Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

        :param node_role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with your node group. The Amazon EKS worker node ``kubelet`` daemon makes calls to AWS APIs on your behalf. Nodes receive permissions for these API calls through an IAM instance profile and associated policies. Before you can launch nodes and register them into a cluster, you must create an IAM role for those nodes to use when they are launched. For more information, see `Amazon EKS node IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html>`_ in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** . If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then don't specify ```IamInstanceProfile`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_IamInstanceProfile.html>`_ in your launch template, or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param subnets: The subnets to use for the Auto Scaling group that is created for your node group.

        :param ami_type: The AMI type for your node group. GPU instance types should use the ``AL2_x86_64_GPU`` AMI type. Non-GPU instances should use the ``AL2_x86_64`` AMI type. Arm instances should use the ``AL2_ARM_64`` AMI type. All types use the Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , and your launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify ``amiType`` , or the node group deployment will fail.

        :param capacity_type: The capacity type of your managed node group.
        :param disk_size: The root device disk size (in GiB) for your node group instances. The default disk size is 20 GiB. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then don't specify ``diskSize`` , or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

If an update fails because pods could not be drained, you can force the update after it fails to terminate the old node whether or not any pods are running on the node.
        :param instance_types: Specify the instance types for a node group. If you specify a GPU instance type, be sure to specify ``AL2_x86_64_GPU`` with the ``amiType`` parameter. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then you can specify zero or one instance type in your launch template *or* you can specify 0-20 instance types for ``instanceTypes`` . If however, you specify an instance type in your launch template *and* specify any ``instanceTypes`` , the node group deployment will fail. If you don't specify an instance type in a launch template or for ``instanceTypes`` , then ``t3.medium`` is used, by default. If you specify ``Spot`` for ``capacityType`` , then we recommend specifying multiple values for ``instanceTypes`` .

        :param labels: The Kubernetes labels to be applied to the nodes in the node group when they are created.
        :param launch_template: An object representing a node group's launch template specification. If specified, then do not specify ``instanceTypes`` , ``diskSize`` , or ``remoteAccess`` and make sure that the launch template meets the requirements in ``launchTemplateSpecification`` .
        :param nodegroup_name: The unique name to give your node group.
        :param release_version: The AMI version of the Amazon EKS optimized AMI to use with your node group (for example, ``1.14.7- *YYYYMMDD*`` ). By default, the latest available AMI version for the node group's current Kubernetes version is used.

If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then don't specify ``remoteAccess`` , or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param scaling_config: The scaling configuration details for the Auto Scaling group that is created for your node group.
        :param tags: The metadata to apply to the node group to assist with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Node group tags do not propagate to any other resources associated with the node group, such as the Amazon EC2 instances or subnets.
        :param taints: The Kubernetes taints to be applied to the nodes in the node group when they are created. Effect is one of ``No_Schedule`` , ``Prefer_No_Schedule`` , or ``No_Execute`` . Kubernetes taints can be used together with tolerations to control how workloads are scheduled to your nodes. For more information, see `Node taints on managed node groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/node-taints-managed-node-groups.html>`_ .
        :param update_config: The node group update configuration.
        :param version: The Kubernetes version to use for your managed nodes. By default, the Kubernetes version of the cluster is used, and this is the only accepted specified value.

        :param cluster_name: The name of the cluster to create the node group in.
        :param node_role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with your node group. The Amazon EKS worker node ``kubelet`` daemon makes calls to AWS APIs on your behalf. Nodes receive permissions for these API calls through an IAM instance profile and associated policies. Before you can launch nodes and register them into a cluster, you must create an IAM role for those nodes to use when they are launched. For more information, see `Amazon EKS node IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html>`_ in the **Amazon EKS User Guide** . If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then don't specify ```IamInstanceProfile`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_IamInstanceProfile.html>`_ in your launch template, or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param subnets: The subnets to use for the Auto Scaling group that is created for your node group. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then don't specify ```SubnetId`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNetworkInterface.html>`_ in your launch template, or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param ami_type: The AMI type for your node group. GPU instance types should use the ``AL2_x86_64_GPU`` AMI type. Non-GPU instances should use the ``AL2_x86_64`` AMI type. Arm instances should use the ``AL2_ARM_64`` AMI type. All types use the Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , and your launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify ``amiType`` , or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param capacity_type: The capacity type of your managed node group.
        :param disk_size: The root device disk size (in GiB) for your node group instances. The default disk size is 20 GiB. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then don't specify ``diskSize`` , or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param force_update_enabled: Force the update if the existing node group's pods are unable to be drained due to a pod disruption budget issue. If an update fails because pods could not be drained, you can force the update after it fails to terminate the old node whether or not any pods are running on the node.
        :param instance_types: Specify the instance types for a node group. If you specify a GPU instance type, be sure to specify ``AL2_x86_64_GPU`` with the ``amiType`` parameter. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then you can specify zero or one instance type in your launch template *or* you can specify 0-20 instance types for ``instanceTypes`` . If however, you specify an instance type in your launch template *and* specify any ``instanceTypes`` , the node group deployment will fail. If you don't specify an instance type in a launch template or for ``instanceTypes`` , then ``t3.medium`` is used, by default. If you specify ``Spot`` for ``capacityType`` , then we recommend specifying multiple values for ``instanceTypes`` . For more information, see `Managed node group capacity types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html#managed-node-group-capacity-types>`_ and `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param labels: The Kubernetes labels to be applied to the nodes in the node group when they are created.
        :param launch_template: An object representing a node group's launch template specification. If specified, then do not specify ``instanceTypes`` , ``diskSize`` , or ``remoteAccess`` and make sure that the launch template meets the requirements in ``launchTemplateSpecification`` .
        :param nodegroup_name: The unique name to give your node group.
        :param release_version: The AMI version of the Amazon EKS optimized AMI to use with your node group (for example, ``1.14.7- *YYYYMMDD*`` ). By default, the latest available AMI version for the node group's current Kubernetes version is used. For more information, see `Amazon EKS optimized Linux AMI Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-linux-ami-versions.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* . .. epigraph:: Changing this value triggers an update of the node group if one is available. However, only the latest available AMI release version is valid as an input. You cannot roll back to a previous AMI release version.
        :param remote_access: The remote access (SSH) configuration to use with your node group. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , then don't specify ``remoteAccess`` , or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .
        :param scaling_config: The scaling configuration details for the Auto Scaling group that is created for your node group.
        :param tags: The metadata to apply to the node group to assist with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Node group tags do not propagate to any other resources associated with the node group, such as the Amazon EC2 instances or subnets.
        :param taints: The Kubernetes taints to be applied to the nodes in the node group when they are created. Effect is one of ``No_Schedule`` , ``Prefer_No_Schedule`` , or ``No_Execute`` . Kubernetes taints can be used together with tolerations to control how workloads are scheduled to your nodes. For more information, see `Node taints on managed node groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/node-taints-managed-node-groups.html>`_ .
        :param update_config: The node group update configuration.
        :param version: The Kubernetes version to use for your managed nodes. By default, the Kubernetes version of the cluster is used, and this is the only accepted specified value. If you specify ``launchTemplate`` , and your launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify ``version`` , or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* .

        :param replacing_update_min_successful_instances_percent: (deprecated) Configuration for replacing updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.ReplacingUpdate. Specifies how many instances must signal success for the update to succeed. Default: minSuccessfulInstancesPercent
        :param resource_signal_count: (deprecated) How many ResourceSignal calls CloudFormation expects before the resource is considered created. Default: 1 if resourceSignalTimeout is set, 0 otherwise
        :param resource_signal_timeout: (deprecated) The length of time to wait for the resourceSignalCount. The maximum value is 43200 (12 hours). Default: Duration.minutes(5) if resourceSignalCount is set, N/A otherwise
        :param rolling_update_configuration: (deprecated) Configuration for rolling updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.RollingUpdate. Default: - RollingUpdateConfiguration with defaults.
        :param signals: (experimental) Configure waiting for signals during deployment. Use this to pause the CloudFormation deployment to wait for the instances in the AutoScalingGroup to report successful startup during creation and updates. The UserData script needs to invoke ``cfn-signal`` with a success or failure code after it is done setting up the instance. Without waiting for signals, the CloudFormation deployment will proceed as soon as the AutoScalingGroup has been created or updated but before the instances in the group have been started. For example, to have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script. For an example, see the verify_instance_health command in the Auto Scaling rolling updates sample template: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/blob/master/aws/services/AutoScaling/AutoScalingRollingUpdates.yaml Default: - Do not wait for signals
        :param spot_price: (experimental) The maximum hourly price (in USD) to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot market price. Default: none
        :param termination_policies: (experimental) A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instances to terminate. The policies are executed in the order that you list them. Default: - ``TerminationPolicy.DEFAULT``
        :param update_policy: (experimental) What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config. Default: - ``UpdatePolicy.rollingUpdate()`` if using ``init``, ``UpdatePolicy.none()`` otherwise
        :param update_type: (deprecated) What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config. Default: UpdateType.None
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place instances within the VPC. Default: - All Private subnets.
