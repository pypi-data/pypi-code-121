# Amazon Lambda Python Library

This library provides constructs for Python Lambda functions.

To use this module, you will need to have Docker installed.

## Python Function

Define a `PythonFunction`:

```python
lambda_.PythonFunction(self, "MyFunction",
    entry="/path/to/my/function",  # required
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,  # required
    index="my_index.py",  # optional, defaults to 'index.py'
    handler="my_exported_func"
)
```

All other properties of `lambda.Function` are supported, see also the [AWS Lambda construct library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-lambda).

## Python Layer

You may create a python-based lambda layer with `PythonLayerVersion`. If `PythonLayerVersion` detects a `requirements.txt`
or `Pipfile` or `poetry.lock` with the associated `pyproject.toml` at the entry path, then `PythonLayerVersion` will include the dependencies inline with your code in the
layer.

Define a `PythonLayerVersion`:

```python
lambda_.PythonLayerVersion(self, "MyLayer",
    entry="/path/to/my/layer"
)
```

A layer can also be used as a part of a `PythonFunction`:

```python
lambda_.PythonFunction(self, "MyFunction",
    entry="/path/to/my/function",
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    layers=[
        lambda_.PythonLayerVersion(self, "MyLayer",
            entry="/path/to/my/layer"
        )
    ]
)
```

## Packaging

If `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile` or `poetry.lock` exists at the entry path, the construct will handle installing all required modules in a [Lambda compatible Docker container](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.7) according to the `runtime` and with the Docker platform based on the target architecture of the Lambda function.

Python bundles are only recreated and published when a file in a source directory has changed.
Therefore (and as a general best-practice), it is highly recommended to commit a lockfile with a
list of all transitive dependencies and their exact versions. This will ensure that when any dependency version is updated, the bundle asset is recreated and uploaded.

To that end, we recommend using [`pipenv`] or [`poetry`] which have lockfile support.

* [`pipenv`](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html#example-pipfile-lock)
* [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control)

Packaging is executed using the `Packaging` class, which:

1. Infers the packaging type based on the files present.
2. If it sees a `Pipfile` or a `poetry.lock` file, it exports it to a compatible `requirements.txt` file with credentials (if they're available in the source files or in the bundling container).
3. Installs dependencies using `pip`.
4. Copies the dependencies into an asset that is bundled for the Lambda package.

**Lambda with a requirements.txt**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── requirements.txt # has to be present at the entry path
```

**Lambda with a Pipfile**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── Pipfile # has to be present at the entry path
├── Pipfile.lock # your lock file
```

**Lambda with a poetry.lock**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── pyproject.toml # your poetry project definition
├── poetry.lock # your poetry lock file has to be present at the entry path
```

## Custom Bundling

Custom bundling can be performed by passing in additional build arguments that point to index URLs to private repos, or by using an entirely custom Docker images for bundling dependencies. The build args currently supported are:

* `PIP_INDEX_URL`
* `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`
* `HTTPS_PROXY`

Additional build args for bundling that refer to PyPI indexes can be specified as:

```python
entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

lambda_.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_python.BundlingOptions(
        build_args={"PIP_INDEX_URL": "https://your.index.url/simple/", "PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL": "https://your.extra-index.url/simple/"}
    )
)
```

If using a custom Docker image for bundling, the dependencies are installed with `pip`, `pipenv` or `poetry` by using the `Packaging` class. A different bundling Docker image that is in the same directory as the function can be specified as:

```python
entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

lambda_.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_python.BundlingOptions(image=image)
)
```

## Custom Bundling with Code Artifact

To use a Code Artifact PyPI repo, the `PIP_INDEX_URL` for bundling the function can be customized (requires AWS CLI in the build environment):

```python
from child_process import exec_sync


entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

domain = "my-domain"
domain_owner = "111122223333"
repo_name = "my_repo"
region = "us-east-1"
code_artifact_auth_token = exec_sync(f"aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --domain {domain} --domain-owner {domainOwner} --query authorizationToken --output text").to_string().trim()

index_url = f"https://aws:{codeArtifactAuthToken}@{domain}-{domainOwner}.d.codeartifact.{region}.amazonaws.com/pypi/{repoName}/simple/"

lambda_.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_python.BundlingOptions(
        environment={"PIP_INDEX_URL": index_url}
    )
)
```

The index URL or the token are only used during bundling and thus not included in the final asset. Setting only environment variable for `PIP_INDEX_URL` or `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` should work for accesing private Python repositories with `pip`, `pipenv` and `poetry` based dependencies.

If you also want to use the Code Artifact repo for building the base Docker image for bundling, use `buildArgs`. However, note that setting custom build args for bundling will force the base bundling image to be rebuilt every time (i.e. skip the Docker cache). Build args can be customized as:

```python
from child_process import exec_sync


entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

domain = "my-domain"
domain_owner = "111122223333"
repo_name = "my_repo"
region = "us-east-1"
code_artifact_auth_token = exec_sync(f"aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --domain {domain} --domain-owner {domainOwner} --query authorizationToken --output text").to_string().trim()

index_url = f"https://aws:{codeArtifactAuthToken}@{domain}-{domainOwner}.d.codeartifact.{region}.amazonaws.com/pypi/{repoName}/simple/"

lambda_.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=lambda.aws_lambda_python.BundlingOptions(
        build_args={"PIP_INDEX_URL": index_url}
    )
)
```

Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: (experimental) The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: (experimental) The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: (experimental) Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: (experimental) The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: (experimental) A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: (experimental) Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: (experimental) Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param layers: (experimental) A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE

        :param profiling: (experimental) Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: (experimental) Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: (experimental) The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: (experimental) Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param security_group: (deprecated) What security group to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. This property is being deprecated, consider using securityGroups instead. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Use securityGroups property instead. Function constructor will throw an error if both are specified.

        :param tracing: (experimental) Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Note: internet access for Lambdas requires a NAT gateway, so picking Public subnets is not allowed. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: (experimental) The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: (experimental) The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: (experimental) The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
