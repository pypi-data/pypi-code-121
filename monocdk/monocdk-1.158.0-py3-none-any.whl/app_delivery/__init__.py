# Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery for CDK Applications

This library includes a *CodePipeline* composite Action for deploying AWS CDK Applications.

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

## Replacement recommended

This library has been deprecated. We recommend you use the
[@aws-cdk/pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/pipelines-readme.html) module instead.

## Limitations

The construct library in it's current form has the following limitations:

1. It can only deploy stacks that are hosted in the same AWS account and region as the *CodePipeline* is.
2. Stacks that make use of `Asset`s cannot be deployed successfully.

## Getting Started

In order to add the `PipelineDeployStackAction` to your *CodePipeline*, you need to have a *CodePipeline* artifact that
contains the result of invoking `cdk synth -o <dir>` on your *CDK App*. You can for example achieve this using a
*CodeBuild* project.

The example below defines a *CDK App* that contains 3 stacks:

* `CodePipelineStack` manages the *CodePipeline* resources, and self-updates before deploying any other stack
* `ServiceStackA` and `ServiceStackB` are service infrastructure stacks, and need to be deployed in this order

```

### `buildspec.yml`

The repository can contain a file at the root level named `buildspec.yml`, or
you can in-line the buildspec. Note that `buildspec.yaml` is not compatible.

For example, a *TypeScript* or *Javascript* CDK App can add the following `buildspec.yml`
at the root of the repository:

```yml
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      # Installs the npm dependencies as defined by the `package.json` file
      # present in the root directory of the package
      # (`cdk init app --language=typescript` would have created one for you)
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      # Builds the CDK App so it can be synthesized
      - npm run build
      # Synthesizes the CDK App and puts the resulting artifacts into `dist`
      - npm run cdk synth -- -o dist
artifacts:
  # The output artifact is all the files in the `dist` directory
  base-directory: dist
  files: '**/*'
```

The `PipelineDeployStackAction` expects it's `input` to contain the result of
synthesizing a CDK App using the `cdk synth -o <directory>`.
