    Object is a helper layout, creating a bokeh Tabs layout from provided Panels, as the bokeh Tabs does.
    Additional to bokeh tabs, a callback is implemented which can trigger the visibilty of view_container
    in the panels provided.
    Whenever a panel is activated all view_container in the Panel will be set to visible.

    Since the bokeh.panels can take a big layouts with buttons etc. we need to provide the view_container for which
    the visibility should be changed in a separate argument.
    This is the visibility_view_containers list. It should be as long as panels.
    The elements of visibility_view_containers should be of type List, they may view_container or be empty.

    Exemplified:
        If a Panel is activated, lets say the second panel (with index 1), all view_container in
        visibility_view_containers[1] will be set to visible=True, all other view_container will be set to
        visible = False
