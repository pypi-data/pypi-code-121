"""
This module contains the GatePresenter

Gates are used to control the signal flow of Sender to its Receiver.

This is very useful whenever we want to only send data to a widget whenever the user
e.g.
 * opens a tab
 * clicks on a button
 * triggers a selection

Different then the selectors for the gates, the GatePresenter ties the the GateModel and the GateView together:
GatePresenter(GateView, GateModel)
See also ref::gate_presenter.

The information flow is:
GateView -> GatePresenter -> GateModel

Whenever the user triggers a GateView, a signal (open/close) is send to the GatePresenter.
The GatePresenter triggers the GateModel.
The Gate model connects/disconnects its ports.

        Connect a view to gates, i.e. if view is clicked or activated a gate will be opened or closed

        Current views are:
            Button, Tabs, RadioButtonGroup, RadioGroup, CheckboxGroup,
            CheckboxButtonGroup, Toggle

        Behavior
        --------
            - Button: on_click will open and close all gates
            - Toggle: toggled button will open all gates, enabled toggle will close all gates

            NB: For the following views: same amount of gates and Tab-panels/Buttons/Checkboxes are required

            - Tabs: The active tab will open the gate with the index in the gates list, all others closed
            - RadioGroup, RadioButtonGroup: The active radio button will open with the index in the gates list,
            all others closed
            -  CheckboxGroup, CheckboxButtonGroup: The checked boxes will open gates with the indices in the gates list,
            all will be others closed
