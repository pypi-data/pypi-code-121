        not be considered.
    blend_best_models: bool, optional
        (New in version v2.19) blend best models during Autopilot run

        SHAP-based insights wherever possible. Defaults to False.
    prepare_model_for_deployment: bool, optional
        (New in version v2.19) Prepare model for deployment during Autopilot run.
        The preparation includes creating reduced feature list models, retraining best model
        on higher sample size, computing insights and assigning "RECOMMENDED FOR DEPLOYMENT" label.
    consider_blenders_in_recommendation: bool, optional
        (New in version 2.22.0) Include blenders when selecting a model to prepare for
        deployment in an Autopilot Run. Defaults to False.

        (New in version v2.19) Compute "All backtest" scores (datetime models) or cross validation
        scores for the specified number of highest ranking models on the Leaderboard,
        if over the Autopilot default.
    autopilot_data_sampling_method: str, optional
        (New in version v2.23) one of ``datarobot.enums.DATETIME_AUTOPILOT_DATA_SAMPLING_METHOD``.
        Applicable for OTV projects only, defines if autopilot uses "random" or "latest" sampling
        when iteratively building models on various training samples. Defaults to "random" for
        duration-based projects and to "latest" for row-based projects.
    run_leakage_removed_feature_list: bool, optional
        (New in version v2.23) Run Autopilot on Leakage Removed feature list (if exists).

        (New in version v2.23) Run supervised feature reduction for feature discovery projects.
    exponentially_weighted_moving_alpha: float, optional
        (New in version v2.26) defaults to None, value between 0 and 1 (inclusive), indicates
        alpha parameter used in exponentially weighted moving average within feature derivation
        window.
    external_time_series_baseline_dataset_id: str, optional.
        (New in version v2.26) If provided, will generate metrics scaled by external model
        predictions metric for time series projects. The external predictions catalog
        must be validated before autopilot starts, see
        ``Project.validate_external_time_series_baseline`` and

        for further explanation.
    use_supervised_feature_reduction: bool, default ``True` optional
        Time Series only. When true, during feature generation DataRobot runs a supervised
        algorithm to retain only qualifying features. Setting to false can
        severely impact autopilot duration, especially for datasets with many features.

        The name of primary location column.
    protected_features: str, optional.

    preferable_target_value: str, optional.
        (New in version v2.24) A target value that should be treated as a favorable outcome
        for the prediction. For example, if we want to check gender discrimination for
        giving a loan and our target is named ``is_bad``, then the positive outcome for
        the prediction would be ``No``, which means that the loan is good and that's
        what we treat as a favorable result for the loaner.
    fairness_metrics_set: str, optional.
        (New in version v2.24) Metric to use for calculating fairness.
        Can be one of ``proportionalParity``, ``equalParity``, ``predictionBalance``,
        ``trueFavorableAndUnfavorableRateParity`` or
        ``favorableAndUnfavorablePredictiveValueParity``.
        Used and required only if *Bias & Fairness in AutoML* feature is enabled.
    fairness_threshold: str, optional.
        (New in version v2.24) Threshold value for the fairness metric.
        Can be in a range of ``[0.0, 1.0]``. If the relative (i.e. normalized) fairness
        score is below the threshold, then the user will see a visual indication on the
    bias_mitigation_feature_name : str, optional
        The feature from protected features that will be used in a bias mitigation task to
        mitigate bias
    bias_mitigation_technique : str, optional
        One of datarobot.enums.BiasMitigationTechnique
        Options:
        - 'preprocessingReweighing'
        - 'postProcessingRejectionOptionBasedClassification'

        we insert into blueprints
    include_bias_mitigation_feature_as_predictor_variable : bool, optional
        Whether we should also use the mitigation feature as in input to the modeler just like
        any other categorical used for training, i.e. do we want the model to "train on" this
        feature in addition to using it for bias mitigation
