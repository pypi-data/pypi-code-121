A construct library for painless Continuous Delivery of CDK applications,
deployed via
[GitHub Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

The CDK already has a CI/CD solution,
[CDK Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines-readme.html),
which creates an AWS CodePipeline that deploys CDK applications. This module
serves the same surface area, except that it is implemented with GitHub
Workflows.

## Usage

Assuming you have a
[`Stage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.Stage.html)
called `MyStage` that includes CDK stacks for your app and you want to deploy it
to two AWS environments (`BETA_ENV` and `PROD_ENV`):

```python
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ShellStep } from 'aws-cdk-lib/pipelines';
import { GitHubWorkflow } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';

const app = new App();

const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(app, 'Pipeline', {
  synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
    commands: [
      'yarn install',
      'yarn build',
    ],
  }),
  gitHubActionRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/GitHubActionRole',
});

pipeline.addStage(new MyStage(app, 'Beta', { env: BETA_ENV }));
pipeline.addStage(new MyStage(app, 'Prod', { env: PROD_ENV }));

app.synth();
```

When you run `cdk synth`, a `deploy.yml` workflow will be created under
`.github/workflows` in your repo. This workflow will deploy your application
based on the definition of the pipeline. In the example above, it will deploy
the two stages in sequence, and within each stage, it will deploy all the
stacks according to their dependency order and maximum parallelism. If your app
uses assets, assets will be published to the relevant destination environment.

The `Pipeline` class from `cdk-pipelines-github` is derived from the base CDK
Pipelines class, so most features should be supported out of the box. See the
[CDK Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines-readme.html)
documentation for more details.

**NOTES:**

* Environments must be bootstrapped separately using `cdk bootstrap`. See [CDK
  Environment
  Bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines-readme.html#cdk-environment-bootstrapping)
  for details.

## Initial Setup

Assuming you have your CDK app checked out on your local machine, here are the suggested steps
to develop your GitHub Workflow.

* Set up AWS Credentials your local environment. It is highly recommended to authenticate via an OpenId
  Connect IAM Role. You can set one up using the [`GithubActionRole`](#github-action-role) class provided
  in this module. For more information (and alternatives), see [AWS Credentials](#aws-credentials).
* When you've updated your pipeline and are ready to deploy, run `cdk synth`. This creates a workflow file
  in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
* When you are ready to test your pipeline, commit your code changes as well as the `deploy.yml` file to
  GitHub. GitHub will automatically try to run the workflow found under `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
* You will be able to see the result of the run on the `Actions` tab in your repository:

For an in-depth run-through on creating your own GitHub Workflow, see the
[Tutorial](#tutorial) section.

## AWS Credentials

There are two ways to supply AWS credentials to the workflow:

* GitHub Action IAM Role (recommended).
* Long-lived AWS Credentials stored in GitHub Secrets.

The GitHub Action IAM Role authenticates via the GitHub OpenID Connect provider
and is recommended, but it requires preparing your AWS account beforehand. This
approach allows your Workflow to exchange short-lived tokens directly from AWS.
With OIDC, benefits include:

* No cloud secrets.
* Authentication and authorization management.
* Rotating credentials.

You can read more
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).

### GitHub Action Role

Authenticating via OpenId Connect means you do not need to store long-lived
credentials as GitHub Secrets. With OIDC, you provide a pre-provisioned IAM
role to your GitHub Workflow via the `gitHubActionRoleArn` property.

```python
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ShellStep } from 'aws-cdk-lib/pipelines';
import { GitHubWorkflow } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';

const app = new App();

const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(app, 'Pipeline', {
  synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
    commands: [
      'yarn install',
      'yarn build',
    ],
  }),
  gitHubActionRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/GitHubActionRole',
});
```

There are two ways to create this IAM role:

* Use the `GitHubActionRole` construct (recommended and described below).
* Manually set up the role ([Guide](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-pipelines-github/blob/main/GITHUB_ACTION_ROLE_SETUP.md)).

#### `GitHubActionRole` Construct

Because this construct involves creating an IAM role in your account, it must
be created separate to your GitHub Workflow and deployed via a normal
`cdk deploy` with your local AWS credentials. Upon successful deployment, the
arn of your newly created IAM role will be exposed as a `CfnOutput`.

To utilize this construct, create a separate CDK stack with the following code
and `cdk deploy`:

```python
import { GitHubActionRole } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';
import { App, Construct, Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';

class MyGitHubActionRole extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const provider = new GitHubActionRole(this, 'github-action-role', {
      repoString: 'myUser/myRepo',
    };
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyGitHubActionRole(app, 'MyGitHubActionRole');
app.synth();
```

Note: If you have previously created the GitHub identity provider with url
`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, the above example will fail
because you can only have one such provider defined per account. In this
case, you must provide the already created provider into your `GithubActionRole`
construct via the `provider` property.

> Make sure the audience for the provider is `sts.amazonaws.com` in this case.

```python
class MyGitHubActionRole extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const provider = new GitHubActionRole(this, 'github-action-role', {
      repos: ['myUser/myRepo'],
      provider: GitHubActionRole.existingGitHubActionsProvider(this),
    });
  }
}
```

### GitHub Secrets

Authenticating via this approach means that you will be manually creating AWS
credentials and duplicating them in GitHub secrets. The workflow expects the
GitHub repository to include secrets with AWS credentials under
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. You can override these defaults
by supplying the `awsCredentials` property to the workflow:

```python
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ShellStep } from 'aws-cdk-lib/pipelines';
import { GitHubWorkflow } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';

const app = new App();

const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(app, 'Pipeline', {
  synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
    commands: [
      'yarn install',
      'yarn build',
    ],
  }),
  awsCredentials: {
    accessKeyId: 'MY_ID', // GitHub will look for the access key id under the secret `MY_ID`
    secretAccessKey: 'MY_KEY', // GitHub will look for the secret access key under the secret `MY_KEY`
  },
});
```

### Using Docker in the Pipeline

You can use Docker in GitHub Workflows in a similar fashion to CDK Pipelines.
For a full discussion on how to use Docker in CDK Pipelines, see
[Using Docker in the Pipeline](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/packages/@aws-cdk/pipelines/README.md#using-docker-in-the-pipeline).

Just like CDK Pipelines, you may need to authenticate to Docker registries to
avoid being throttled.

#### Authenticating to Docker registries

You can specify credentials to use for authenticating to Docker registries as
part of the Workflow definition. This can be useful if any Docker image assets —
in the pipeline or any of the application stages — require authentication, either
due to being in a different environment (e.g., ECR repo) or to avoid throttling
(e.g., DockerHub).

```python
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ShellStep } from 'aws-cdk-lib/pipelines';
import { GitHubWorkflow } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';

const app = new App();

const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(app, 'Pipeline', {
  synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
    commands: [
      'yarn install',
      'yarn build',
    ],
  }),
  dockerCredentials: [
    // Authenticate to ECR
    DockerCredential.ecr('<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com'),

    // Authenticate to DockerHub
    DockerCredential.dockerHub({
      // These properties are defaults; feel free to omit
      usernameKey: 'DOCKERHUB_USERNAME',
      personalAccessTokenKey: 'DOCKERHUB_TOKEN',
    }),

    // Authenticate to Custom Registries
    DockerCredential.customRegistry('custom-registry', {
      usernameKey: 'CUSTOM_USERNAME',
      passwordKey: 'CUSTOM_PASSWORD',
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Runner Types

You can choose to run the workflow in either a GitHub hosted or [self-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) runner.

### GitHub Hosted Runner

The default is `Runner.UBUNTU_LATEST`. You can override this as shown below:

```python
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ShellStep } from 'aws-cdk-lib/pipelines';
import { GitHubWorkflow } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';

const app = new App();

const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(app, 'Pipeline', {
  synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
    commands: [
      'yarn install',
      'yarn build',
    ],
  }),
  runner: Runner.WINDOWS_LATEST,
});
```

### Self Hosted Runner

The following example shows how to configure the workflow to run on a self-hosted runner. Note that you do not need to pass in `self-hosted` explicitly as a label.

```python
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ShellStep } from 'aws-cdk-lib/pipelines';
import { GitHubWorkflow } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';

const app = new App();

const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(app, 'Pipeline', {
  synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
    commands: [
      'yarn install',
      'yarn build',
    ],
  }),
  runner: Runner.selfHosted(['label1', 'label2']),
});
```

## Additional Features

Below is a compilation of additional features available for GitHub Workflows.

### Configure GitHub Environment

You can run your GitHub Workflow in select
[GitHub Environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).
Via the GitHub UI, you can configure environments with protection rules and secrets, and reference
those environments in your CDK app. A workflow that references an environment must follow any
protection rules for the environment before running or accessing the environment's secrets.

Assuming (just like in the main [example](#usage)) you have a
[`Stage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.Stage.html)
called `MyStage` that includes CDK stacks for your app and you want to deploy it
to two AWS environments (`BETA_ENV` and `PROD_ENV`) as well as GitHub Environments
`beta` and `prod`:

```python
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ShellStep } from 'aws-cdk-lib/pipelines';
import { GitHubWorkflow } from 'cdk-pipelines-github';

const app = new App();

const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(app, 'Pipeline', {
  synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
    commands: [
      'yarn install',
      'yarn build',
    ],
  }),
  gitHubActionRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/GitHubActionRole',
});

pipeline.addStageWithGitHubOptions(new MyStage(this, 'Beta', {
  env: BETA_ENV,
  gitHubEnvironment: 'beta',
}));
pipeline.addStageWithGitHubOptions(new MyStage(this, 'Prod', {
  env: PROD_ENV,
  gitHubEnvironment: 'prod',
}));

app.synth();
```

#### Manual Approval Step

One use case for using GitHub Environments with your CDK Pipeline is to create a
manual approval step for specific environments via Environment protection rules.
From the GitHub UI, you can specify up to 5 required reviewers that must approve
before the deployment can proceed:

<img width="1134" alt="require-reviewers" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7248260/163494925-627f5ca7-a34e-48fa-bec7-1e4924ab6c0c.png">

For more information and a tutorial for how to set this up, see this
[discussion](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-pipelines-github/issues/162).

## Tutorial

You can find an example usage in [test/example-app.ts](./test/example-app.ts)
which includes a simple CDK app and a pipeline.

You can find a repository that uses this example here: [eladb/test-app-cdkpipeline](https://github.com/eladb/test-app-cdkpipeline).

To run the example, clone this repository and install dependencies:

```shell
cd ~/projects # or some other playground space
git clone https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-pipelines-github
cd cdk-pipelines-github
yarn
```

Now, create a new GitHub repository and clone it as well:

```shell
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/myaccount/my-test-repository
```

You'll need to set up AWS credentials in your environment. Note that this tutorial uses
long-lived GitHub secrets as credentials for simplicity, but it is recommended to set up
a GitHub OIDC role instead.

```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxx
```

Bootstrap your environments:

```shell
export CDK_NEW_BOOTSTRAP=1
npx cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNTID/us-east-1
npx cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNTID/eu-west-2
```

Now, run the `manual-test.sh` script when your working directory is the new repository:

```shell
cd ~/projects/my-test-repository
~/projects/cdk-piplines/github/test/manual-test.sh
```

This will produce a `cdk.out` directory and a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.

Commit and push these files to your repo and you should see the deployment
workflow in action. Make sure your GitHub repository has `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secrets that can access the same account that you
synthesized against.

> In this tutorial, you are supposed to commit `cdk.out` (i.e. the code is pre-synthed).
> Do not do this in your app; you should always synth during the synth step of the GitHub
> workflow. In the example app this is achieved through the `preSynthed: true` option.
> It is for example purposes only and is not something you should do in your app.
>
> ```python
> const pipeline = new GitHubWorkflow(new App(), 'Pipeline', {
>   synth: new ShellStep('Build', {
>     commands: ['echo "nothing to do (cdk.out is committed)"'],
>   }),
>   // only the example app should do this. your app should synth in the synth step.
>   preSynthed: true,
> });
> ```

## Not supported yet

Most features that exist in CDK Pipelines are supported. However, as the CDK Pipelines
feature are expands, the feature set for GitHub Workflows may lag behind. If you see a
feature that you feel should be supported by GitHub Workflows, please open a GitHub issue
to track it.

        :param delete: Runs your workflow anytime someone deletes a branch or tag, which triggers the delete event.
        :param deployment: Runs your workflow anytime someone creates a deployment, which triggers the deployment event. Deployments created with a commit SHA may not have a Git ref.
        :param deployment_status: Runs your workflow anytime a third party provides a deployment status, which triggers the deployment_status event. Deployments created with a commit SHA may not have a Git ref.
        :param fork: Runs your workflow anytime when someone forks a repository, which triggers the fork event.
        :param gollum: Runs your workflow when someone creates or updates a Wiki page, which triggers the gollum event.
        :param issue_comment: Runs your workflow anytime the issue_comment event occurs.

        :param label: Runs your workflow anytime the label event occurs.
        :param milestone: Runs your workflow anytime the milestone event occurs.

        :param project: Runs your workflow anytime the project event occurs.
        :param project_card: Runs your workflow anytime the project_card event occurs.
        :param project_column: Runs your workflow anytime the project_column event occurs.
        :param public: Runs your workflow anytime someone makes a private repository public, which triggers the public event.
        :param pull_request: Runs your workflow anytime the pull_request event occurs.
        :param pull_request_review: Runs your workflow anytime the pull_request_review event occurs.
        :param pull_request_review_comment: Runs your workflow anytime a comment on a pull request's unified diff is modified, which triggers the pull_request_review_comment event.
        :param pull_request_target: This event runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the merge commit as the pull_request event does. This prevents executing unsafe workflow code from the head of the pull request that could alter your repository or steal any secrets you use in your workflow. This event allows you to do things like create workflows that label and comment on pull requests based on the contents of the event payload. WARNING: The ``pull_request_target`` event is granted read/write repository token and can access secrets, even when it is triggered from a fork. Although the workflow runs in the context of the base of the pull request, you should make sure that you do not check out, build, or run untrusted code from the pull request with this event. Additionally, any caches share the same scope as the base branch, and to help prevent cache poisoning, you should not save the cache if there is a possibility that the cache contents were altered.
        :param push: Runs your workflow when someone pushes to a repository branch, which triggers the push event.
        :param registry_package: Runs your workflow anytime a package is published or updated.
        :param release: Runs your workflow anytime the release event occurs.
        :param repository_dispatch: You can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called repository_dispatch when you want to trigger a workflow for activity that happens outside of GitHub.
        :param schedule: You can schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using POSIX cron syntax. Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default or base branch. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.
        :param status: Runs your workflow anytime the status of a Git commit changes, which triggers the status event.
        :param watch: Runs your workflow anytime the watch event occurs.
        :param workflow_dispatch: You can configure custom-defined input properties, default input values, and required inputs for the event directly in your workflow. When the workflow runs, you can access the input values in the github.event.inputs context.
        :param workflow_run: This event occurs when a workflow run is requested or completed, and allows you to execute a workflow based on the finished result of another workflow. A workflow run is triggered regardless of the result of the previous workflow.
