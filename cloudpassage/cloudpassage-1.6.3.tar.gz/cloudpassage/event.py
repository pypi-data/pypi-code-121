        Default filter returns ALL events.  This is a very verbose and

        Filtering is done with keyword arguments, some of which are listed
        below. An exhaustive list of filters can be found at
        https://api-doc.cloudpassage.com/help#events

                the group IDs to retrieve events for.
            server_id (list or str): A list or comma-separated string
                containing the server IDs to retrieve events for.
            server_platform (str): (linux | windows)
            critical (bool): Returns only critical or noncritical events.
            type (list or str): A list or comma-separated string containing the
                event types to query for.  A complete list of event types is
                available here:
                https://api-doc.cloudpassage.com/help#event-types
            since (str): ISO 8601 formatted string representing the starting

            until (str): ISO 8601 formatted string representing the ending
