    """Create a Dask cluster with Coiled

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_workers
        Number of workers in this cluster. Defaults to 4.
    name
        Name to use for identifying this cluster. Defaults to ``None``.
    software
        Name of the software environment to use.
    worker_class
        Worker class to use. Defaults to "dask.distributed.Nanny".
    worker_options
        Mapping with keyword arguments to pass to ``worker_class``. Defaults
        to ``{}``.
    worker_vm_types
        List of instance types that you would like workers to use, default instance type
        selected contains 2 cores. You can use the command ``coiled.list_instance_types()``
        to se a list of allowed types.
    worker_cpu
        Number of CPUs allocated for each worker, you may specify a range of cores by
        using a list of two elements, for example: ``worker_cpu=[2, 8]``.
    worker_memory
        Amount of memory to allocate for each worker, Coiled will use a +/- 10% buffer
        from the memory that you specify. You may specify a range of memory by using a
        list of two elements, for example: ``worker_memory=["2GiB", "4GiB"]``.
    worker_gpu
        For instance types that don't come with a fixed number of GPUs, the number of
        GPUs to attach. This only applies to GCP, and will default to 1 if you specify
        ``worker_gpu_type``. Coiled currently only supports a single GPU per instance.
    worker_gpu_type
        For instance types that don't always come with GPU, the type of GPU to attach.
        This only applied to GCP. Should match the way the cloud provider specifies the
        GPU, for example: ``worker_gpu_type="nvidia-tesla-t4"``.
    scheduler_class
        Scheduler class to use. Defaults to "dask.distributed.Scheduler".
    scheduler_options
        Mapping with keyword arguments to pass to ``scheduler_class``. Defaults
        to ``{}``.
    scheduler_vm_types
        List of instance types that you would like the scheduler to use, default instances
        type selected contains 2 cores. You can use the command
        ``coiled.list_instance_types()`` to se a list of allowed types.
    scheduler_cpu
        Number of CPUs allocated for the scheduler, you may specify a range of cores by
        using a list of two elements, for example: ``scheduler_cpu=[2, 8]``.
    scheduler_memory
        Amount of memory to allocate for the scheduler, Coiled will use a +/-10%
        buffer from the memory what you specify. You may specify a range of memory by using a
        list of two elements, for example: ``scheduler_memory=["2GiB", "4GiB"]``.
    asynchronous
        Set to True if using this Cloud within ``async``/``await`` functions or
        within Tornado ``gen.coroutines``. Otherwise this should remain
        ``False`` for normal use. Default is ``False``.
    cloud
        Cloud object to use for interacting with Coiled. This object contains user/authentication/account
        information. If this is None (default), we look for a recently-cached Cloud object, and if none
        exists create one.
    account
        Name of Coiled account to use. If not provided, will
        default to the user account for the ``cloud`` object being used.
    shutdown_on_close
        Whether or not to shut down the cluster when it finishes.
        Defaults to True, unless name points to an existing cluster.
    use_scheduler_public_ip
        Boolean value that determines if the Python client connects to the
        Dask scheduler using the scheduler machine's public IP address. The
        default behaviour when set to True is to connect to the scheduler
        using its public IP address, which means traffic will be routed over
        the public internet. When set to False, traffic will be routed over
        the local network the scheduler lives in, so make sure the scheduler
        private IP address is routable from where this function call is made
        when setting this to False.
    credentials
        Which credentials to use for Dask operations and forward to Dask
        clusters -- options are "account", "local", or "none". The default
        behavior is to prefer credentials associated with the Coiled Account,
        if available, then try to use local credentials, if available.
        NOTE: credential handling currently only works with AWS credentials.
    timeout
        Timeout in seconds to wait for a cluster to start, will use
        ``default_cluster_timeout`` set on parent Cloud by default.
    environ
        Dictionary of environment variables.
    backend_options
        Dictionary of backend specific options
    wait_for_workers
        Whether or not to wait for a number of workers before returning control
        of the prompt back to the user. Usually, computations will run better
        if you wait for most workers before submitting tasks to the cluster.
        You can wait for all workers by passing ``True``, or not wait for any
        by passing ``False``. You can pass a fraction of the total number of
        workers requested as a float(like 0.6), or a fixed number of workers
        as an int (like 13). If None, the value from ``coiled.wait-for-workers``
        in your Dask config will be used. Default: 0.3. If the requested number
        of workers don't launch within 10 minutes, the cluster will be shut
        down, then a TimeoutError is raised.
