Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allow you to monitor your application by generating **synthetic** traffic. The traffic is produced by a **canary**: a configurable script that runs on a schedule. You configure the canary script to follow the same routes and perform the same actions as a user, which allows you to continually verify your user experience even when you don't have any traffic on your applications.

## Canary

To illustrate how to use a canary, assume your application defines the following endpoint:

```console
% curl "https://api.example.com/user/books/topbook/"
The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

```

The below code defines a canary that will hit the `books/topbook` endpoint every 5 minutes:

```python
canary = synthetics.Canary(self, "MyCanary",
    schedule=synthetics.Schedule.rate(Duration.minutes(5)),
    test=synthetics.Test.custom(
        code=synthetics.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "canary")),
        handler="index.handler"
    ),
    runtime=synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_1,
    environment_variables={
        "stage": "prod"
    }
)
```

The following is an example of an `index.js` file which exports the `handler` function:

```js
const synthetics = require('Synthetics');
const log = require('SyntheticsLogger');

const pageLoadBlueprint = async function () {
  // Configure the stage of the API using environment variables
  const url = `https://api.example.com/${process.env.stage}/user/books/topbook/`;

  const page = await synthetics.getPage();
  const response = await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 });
  // Wait for page to render. Increase or decrease wait time based on endpoint being monitored.
  await page.waitFor(15000);
  // This will take a screenshot that will be included in test output artifacts.
  await synthetics.takeScreenshot('loaded', 'loaded');
  const pageTitle = await page.title();
  log.info('Page title: ' + pageTitle);
  if (response.status() !== 200) {
    throw 'Failed to load page!';
  }
};

exports.handler = async () => {
  return await pageLoadBlueprint();
};
```

> **Note:** The function **must** be called `handler`.

The canary will automatically produce a CloudWatch Dashboard:

![UI Screenshot](images/ui-screenshot.png)

The Canary code will be executed in a lambda function created by Synthetics on your behalf. The Lambda function includes a custom [runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library.html) provided by Synthetics. The provided runtime includes a variety of handy tools such as [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core) (for nodejs based one) and Chromium.

To learn more about Synthetics capabilities, check out the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html).

### Canary Schedule

You can specify the schedule on which a canary runs by providing a
[`Schedule`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-synthetics.Schedule.html)
object to the `schedule` property.

Configure a run rate of up to 60 minutes with `Schedule.rate`:

```python
schedule = synthetics.Schedule.rate(Duration.minutes(5))
```

You can also specify a [cron expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_cron.html) with `Schedule.cron`:

```python
schedule = synthetics.Schedule.cron(
    hour="0,8,16"
)
```

If you want the canary to run just once upon deployment, you can use `Schedule.once()`.

### Configuring the Canary Script

To configure the script the canary executes, use the `test` property. The `test` property accepts a `Test` instance that can be initialized by the `Test` class static methods. Currently, the only implemented method is `Test.custom()`, which allows you to bring your own code. In the future, other methods will be added. `Test.custom()` accepts `code` and `handler` properties -- both are required by Synthetics to create a lambda function on your behalf.

The `synthetics.Code` class exposes static methods to bundle your code artifacts:

* `code.fromInline(code)` - specify an inline script.
* `code.fromAsset(path)` - specify a .zip file or a directory in the local filesystem which will be zipped and uploaded to S3 on deployment. See the above Note for directory structure.
* `code.fromBucket(bucket, key[, objectVersion])` - specify an S3 object that contains the .zip file of your runtime code. See the above Note for directory structure.

Using the `Code` class static initializers:

```python
# To supply the code from a S3 bucket:
import aws_cdk.aws_s3 as s3
# To supply the code inline:
synthetics.Canary(self, "Inline Canary",
    test=synthetics.Test.custom(
        code=synthetics.Code.from_inline("/* Synthetics handler code */"),
        handler="index.handler"
    ),
    runtime=synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_4
)

# To supply the code from your local filesystem:
synthetics.Canary(self, "Asset Canary",
    test=synthetics.Test.custom(
        code=synthetics.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "canary")),
        handler="index.handler"
    ),
    runtime=synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_4
)
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Code Bucket")
synthetics.Canary(self, "Bucket Canary",
    test=synthetics.Test.custom(
        code=synthetics.Code.from_bucket(bucket, "canary.zip"),
        handler="index.handler"
    ),
    runtime=synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_4
)
```

> **Note:** Synthetics have a specified folder structure for canaries. For Node scripts supplied via `code.fromAsset()` or `code.fromBucket()`, the canary resource requires the following folder structure:
>
> ```plaintext
> canary/
> ├── nodejs/
>    ├── node_modules/
>         ├── <filename>.js
> ```
>
> For Python scripts supplied via `code.fromAsset()` or `code.fromBucket()`, the canary resource requires the following folder structure:
>
> ```plaintext
> canary/
> ├── python/
>     ├── <filename>.py
> ```
>
> See Synthetics [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_WritingCanary.html).

### Running a canary on a VPC

You can specify what [VPC a canary executes in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html).
This can allow for monitoring services that may be internal to a specific VPC. To place a canary within a VPC, you can specify the `vpc` property with the desired `VPC` to place then canary in.
This will automatically attach the appropriate IAM permissions to attach to the VPC. This will also create a Security Group and attach to the default subnets for the VPC unless specified via `vpcSubnets` and `securityGroups`.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_ec2 as ec2

# vpc: ec2.IVpc

synthetics.Canary(self, "Vpc Canary",
    test=synthetics.Test.custom(
        code=synthetics.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "canary")),
        handler="index.handler"
    ),
    runtime=synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_4,
    vpc=vpc
)
```

> **Note:** By default, the Synthetics runtime needs access to the S3 and CloudWatch APIs, which will fail in a private subnet without internet access enabled (e.g. an isolated subnnet).
>
> Ensure that the Canary is placed in a VPC either with internet connectivity or with VPC Endpoints for S3 and CloudWatch enabled and configured.
>
> See [Synthetics VPC docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html).

### Alarms

You can configure a CloudWatch Alarm on a canary metric. Metrics are emitted by CloudWatch automatically and can be accessed by the following APIs:

* `canary.metricSuccessPercent()` - percentage of successful canary runs over a given time
* `canary.metricDuration()` - how much time each canary run takes, in seconds.
* `canary.metricFailed()` - number of failed canary runs over a given time

Create an alarm that tracks the canary metric:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_cloudwatch as cloudwatch

# canary: synthetics.Canary

cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "CanaryAlarm",
    metric=canary.metric_success_percent(),
    evaluation_periods=2,
    threshold=90,
    comparison_operator=cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.LESS_THAN_THRESHOLD
)
```

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::Synthetics::Canary``.

    Creates or updates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.

    To create canaries, you must have the ``CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess`` policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the the ``iam:CreateRole`` , ``iam:CreatePolicy`` and ``iam:AttachRolePolicy`` permissions. For more information, see `Necessary Roles and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles>`_ .

        :param schedule: A structure that contains information about how often the canary is to run, and when these runs are to stop.
        :param start_canary_after_creation: Specify TRUE to have the canary start making runs immediately after it is created. A canary that you create using CloudFormation can't be used to monitor the CloudFormation stack that creates the canary or to roll back that stack if there is a failure.
        :param artifact_config: A structure that contains the configuration for canary artifacts, including the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3.
        :param delete_lambda_resources_on_canary_deletion: Specifies whether AWS CloudFormation is to also delete the Lambda functions and layers used by this canary, when the canary is deleted. The default is false.
        :param failure_retention_period: The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is 1 to 455 days.
        :param run_config: A structure that contains input information for a canary run. If you omit this structure, the frequency of the canary is used as canary's timeout value, up to a maximum of 900 seconds.
        :param success_retention_period: The number of days to retain data about successful runs of this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is 1 to 455 days.
        :param tags: The list of key-value pairs that are associated with the canary.
        :param visual_reference: If this canary performs visual monitoring by comparing screenshots, this structure contains the ID of the canary run to use as the baseline for screenshots, and the coordinates of any parts of the screen to ignore during the visual monitoring comparison.
        :param vpc_config: If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure contains information about the subnet and security groups of the VPC endpoint.
