### Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes

[![build](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/workflows/release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/actions/workflows/release.yml)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cdk8s.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cdk8s)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cdk8s.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cdk8s)

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes
applications using rich object-oriented APIs. It allows developers to leverage
the full power of software in order to define abstract components called
"constructs" which compose Kubernetes resources or other constructs into
higher-level abstractions.

> **Note:** This repository is the "core library" of cdk8s, with logic for synthesizing Kubernetes manifests using the [constructs framework](https://github.com/aws/constructs). It is published to NPM as [`cdk8s`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk8s) and should not be confused with the cdk8s command-line tool [`cdk8s-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk8s-cli). For more general information about cdk8s, please see [cdk8s.io](https://cdk8s.io), or visit the umbrella repository located at [cdk8s-team/cdk8s](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s).

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list. Default: - No finalizers.

        :param name: The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster. Normally, you shouldn't specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness. You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the ``chart.generateObjectName`` method. If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won't be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified. Default: - an app-unique name generated by the chart
        :param namespace: Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.

If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers.
